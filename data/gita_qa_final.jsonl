{"question": "Why was there a need to reestablish the disciplic succession for Bhagavad-gita, according to the purport of Gita 4.2?", "answer": "The purport explains that as soon as the original purpose of the Gita was scattered by the motives of unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago, the Lord Himself detected the succession was broken.

{"question": "What was Arjuna's question to Krsna in Bhagavad Gita 4.4, regarding Krsna's instruction of yoga to Vivasvan?", "answer": "Arjuna asked: 'The sun-god Vivasvan (param janma vivasvatah) is senior by birth to You (aparam bhavato janma).

A living entity, however great, can never equal the Supreme Lord.

{"question": "How is Krsna's appearance and disappearance like the sun's rising and setting, according to the purport of Gita 4.6?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna's appearance and disappearance is like the sun's. When the sun is out of sight, we think it has set; when before our eyes, we think it's on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always fixed.

{"question": "How does the liberation achieved by a devotee differ from that of impersonalists and yogis, according to the purport of Gita 4.9?", "answer": "The purport explains impersonalists and yogis attain liberation (merging into brahmajyoti) after much trouble and many births, but it's only partial with risk of returning to the material world. A devotee, simply by understanding the Lord's transcendental nature and activities, attains the Lord's abode after this body and doesn't risk returning.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "9"}

{"question": "How does Krsna reciprocate with different types of worshippers, including pure devotees, impersonalists, and fruitive workers, according to the purport of Gita 4.11?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna reciprocates according to one's desire.

God is one (Krsna/Narayana/Visnu); parts are many. Demigods are living entities with material power. Anyone who thinks God and demigods are on the same level is an atheist or 'pasandi'. Even Brahma and Siva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "12"}
{"question": "How were the four divisions of human society ('catur-varnyam') created by Krsna, and what is His position regarding this system, as stated in Bhagavad Gita 4.13?", "answer": "Krsna states in Gita 4.13: 'According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them (guna-karma-vibhagasah), the four divisions of human society were created by Me (catur-varnyam maya srstam).

One who understands this truth about Me (iti mam yo 'bhijanati) also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work (karmabhir na sa badhyate).'", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "14"}
{"question": "Why is the Lord not affected by material activities, unlike living entities, according to the purport of Gita 4.14?", "answer": "The purport explains the Lord, though creator, is aloof from creation's activities, like a king not subject to state laws. Living entities are entangled in fruitive results due to their propensity for lording over material resources and sense gratification. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for such things. He only gives facilities; living entities are responsible for their own acts.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "14"}

{"question": "Is it better to retire from Krsna conscious activities or engage in them for Krsna's sake, according to the purport of Gita 4.15?", "answer": "The purport states that retiring from Krsna conscious activities and making a show of Krsna consciousness is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for Krsna's sake.

{"question": "Why did the Lord decide to instruct Arjuna directly in Krsna consciousness, as per the purport of Gita 4.16?", "answer": "The purport explains one has to follow previous authorities in disciplic succession; otherwise, even intelligent men will be bewildered. The Lord decided to instruct Arjuna directly so that anyone following Arjuna's footsteps would not be bewildered.

{"question": "What three things should one understand properly due to the difficulty of their intricacies, as mentioned in Bhagavad Gita 4.17?", "answer": "Gita 4.17 states: 'The intricacies of action are very hard to understand (gahana karmano gatih).

{"question": "Who is considered intelligent among men ('sa buddhiman manusyesu') and in the transcendental position, according to Bhagavad Gita 4.18?", "answer": "Gita 4.18 states: 'One who sees inaction in action (karmany akarma yah pasyed), and action in inaction (akarmani ca karma yah), is intelligent among men (sa buddhiman manusyesu), and he is in the transcendental position (sa yuktah), although engaged in all sorts of activities (krtsna-karma-krt).'", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "18"}
{"question": "What does 'akarma' mean, and how does a person acting in Krsna consciousness achieve this state, as per the purport of Gita 4.18?", "answer": "The purport explains 'akarma' means without reaction to work. A person acting in Krsna consciousness is naturally free from karma's bonds because all activities are for Krsna; they don't enjoy or suffer work's effects. The sense of eternal servitorship to Krsna makes one immune to all reactionary elements of work.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "18"}

{"question": "What is the development of knowledge of eternal servitorship to the Lord compared to, and what can it do, as per the purport of Gita 4.19?", "answer": "The purport compares the development of this knowledge to fire. Such a fire, once kindled, can burn up all kinds of reactions to work.

{"question": "How does a man of understanding act, and is he affected by sinful reactions when working only for bare necessities, as per Bhagavad Gita 4.21?", "answer": "Gita 4.21 states: 'Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly controlled (nirasir yata-cittatma), gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions (tyakta-sarva-parigrahah) and acts only for the bare necessities of life (sariram kevalam karma kurvan).

They are dovetailed with the supreme desire, having no desire for personal sense gratification, moving like a machine part. Like an animal having no proprietorship over its body (even if a cruel owner kills it, it doesn't protest), the Krsna conscious person, engaged in self-realization, has little time to falsely possess material objects and doesn't use unfair means, thus remaining free from material sins and reactions.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "21"}

{"question": "How does a Krsna conscious person handle duality like heat/cold or misery/happiness, and why are they steady in success and failure, as per the purport of Gita 4.22?", "answer": "The purport explains a Krsna conscious person is above duality because they don't hesitate to act in any way for Krsna's satisfaction.

{"question": "How does one become freed from dualities and material mode contaminations, according to the purport of Gita 4.23?", "answer": "The purport states that by becoming fully Krsna conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus from the contaminations of the material modes. This liberation happens because they know their constitutional position in relationship with Krsna, and their mind cannot be drawn from Krsna consciousness.

{"question": "What is 'Brahman' and 'brahmajyoti', and how does Krsna consciousness convert illusory consciousness into Brahman, according to the purport of Gita 4.24?", "answer": "The purport explains 'Brahman' means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are 'brahmajyoti,' His spiritual effulgence. Everything exists in brahmajyoti. When jyoti is covered by illusion (maya) or sense gratification, it's material. Krsna consciousness is the process of converting illusory consciousness into Brahman (the Supreme).

The goal is 'pratyag-atma', withdrawal from activities in matter. The senses interact with sense objects (functions of prana-vayu). Other vayus (apana, vyana, samana, udana) also function.

{"question": "Explain 'dravyamaya-yajna' and 'tapomaya-yajna' with examples, as described in the purport of Gita 4.28.", "answer": "The purport explains: 'Dravyamaya-yajna' is sacrificing possessions via charities, like dharma-sala, anna-ksetra, hospitals, old age homes, free food/education/medical treatment. 'Tapomaya-yajna' is voluntarily accepting austerities like candrayana or caturmasya (not shaving for 4 months, restricted eating, not leaving home) for higher elevation or promotion to higher planets.

Apana air goes down, prana up. Yogi practices breathing oppositely until currents neutralize into 'puraka' (equilibrium). Offering exhaled breath to inhaled is 'recaka'. When both air currents stop, it's 'kumbhaka-yoga', increasing longevity.

{"question": "What is the common aim of all different types of sacrifice, and what platform does one need to reach to be elevated to the eternal platform, as per the purport of Gita 4.30?", "answer": "The purport states the common aim of all sacrifices is to control the senses. Sense gratification is the root of material existence. Unless one is on a platform apart from sense gratification, there's no chance of elevation to the eternal platform of full knowledge, bliss, and life (Brahman atmosphere).

{"question": "How does the path of religion or yajna solve economic problems and lead to liberation, according to the purport of Gita 4.31?", "answer": "The purport explains the human form is a loophole to escape material entanglement. Vedas give paths of religion (yajna), economic comfort, regulated sense gratification, and liberation. Performing yajna solves economic problems (enough food, milk).

{"question": "What constitutes the proper combination for spiritual understanding from a spiritual master, and what is condemned in Gita 4.34, according to its purport?", "answer": "The purport states inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must pass the spiritual master's test. Blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One must hear submissively, get clear understanding via submission, service, and inquiries.

The whole teaching of the Gita is targeted toward this end: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be separated from Krsna, and his sense of being an identity apart from Krsna is maya.

Action in Krsna consciousness isn't fruitive and strengthens real knowledge. Mere renunciation without Krsna consciousness doesn't purify the heart; one must still work fruitively.

Sankhya concludes the living entity is part of the supreme spirit, his actions must relate to the Supreme. Devotional yoga involves acting in Krsna consciousness, one's constitutional position.

Though appearing to act with body/senses, they are conscious of their spiritual engagement. In material consciousness, senses are for sense gratification; in Krsna consciousness, senses are for satisfying Krsna's senses.

{"question": "What is the secret of Krsna consciousness that leads to peace and fearlessness, as explained in the purport of Gita 5.12?", "answer": "The purport explains the difference between a Krsna conscious person (attached to Krsna) and one in bodily consciousness (attached to activity results). The Krsna conscious person is liberated, not anxious for fruitive rewards. In Krsna consciousness, there's no duality; all is Krsna's energy, and Krsna is all good.

{"question": "How can one become aloof from bodily activities and revive their real position, according to the purport of Gita 5.13, citing Svetasvatara Upanisad?", "answer": "The purport explains the embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates (body). Due to forgetfulness of superior nature, he identifies with the material body and suffers. By Krsna consciousness, he can revive his real position and come out of embodiment, becoming aloof from bodily activities. The Svetasvatara Upanisad (3.18) says the Lord within controls all.

{"question": "What is the cause of bodily suffering and distress, and what is the best solution for the living entity struggling in the material ocean, as per the purport of Gita 5.14?", "answer": "The purport explains the temporary body is the cause of varied activities and reactions. Living in this conditional atmosphere, one suffers by identifying with the body in ignorance. This ignorance, acquired since time immemorial, is the cause of bodily suffering.

The Lord is omnipotent (vibhu); the living entity is atomic (anu). The living entity desires by free will; such desire is fulfilled by the omnipotent Lord.

They know they are not the body but part of the Supreme. This steadiness of mind (not joyful in gain, not lamenting in loss related to body) is 'sthira-buddhi' (self-intelligence).

When one knows Krsna is the fountainhead of everything and acts in that spirit, they act for everyone. Humanity's sufferings are due to forgetting Krsna as supreme enjoyer, proprietor, friend.

Similarly, a devotee in Krsna consciousness, though far from Lord's abode, can elevate himself there simply by thinking of Him constantly (engagement in Krsna consciousness).

The beginning is 'yogaruruksu' stage (fruitive material activities like asanas for mental equilibrium and sense control).

One controlled by the mind is 'go-dasa' (servant of senses). A gosvami knows transcendental sense happiness: senses engaged in service of Hrsikesa (Krsna, supreme owner of senses).

Distress is from forgetting God relationship; happiness is knowing Krsna as supreme enjoyer, proprietor, friend.

More one hears, more enlightened and detached one becomes from things drawing mind from Krsna. 'Vairagya' means detachment from matter and engagement of mind in spirit. Attaching mind to Krsna's activities is easier than impersonal detachment.

{"question": "For whom is self-realization ('yogah') difficult work ('dusprapah'), and for whom is it practical to achieve by right means ('sakyo 'vaptum upayatah'), according to Krsna's opinion in Bhagavad Gita 6.36?", "answer": "Krsna stated in Gita 6.36: 'For one whose mind is unbridled (asamyatatmana), self-realization (yogah) is difficult work (dusprapa iti me matih).

Yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time, possibly materially lucrative but useless spiritually. Mind must be controlled by constant engagement in Lord's transcendental loving service.

{"question": "Why is Krsna's verdict considered final and complete for all doubts, as per the purport of Gita 6.39?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna is the perfect knower of past, present, and future. No one, including great sages/philosophers at material nature's mercy, equals Him. Therefore, Krsna's verdict is final and complete because He knows everything perfectly, but no one knows Him.

{"question": "What are the two classes of unsuccessful yogis, and what opportunities are they given by the Lord's grace, as per the purport of Gita 6.41?", "answer": "The purport divides unsuccessful yogis: one fallen after little progress, one after long practice. The one with short practice goes to higher planets of pious entities, lives long, then is reborn on this planet in a righteous brahmana vaisnava or aristocratic merchant family.

{"question": "Why is birth in a family of yogis or transcendentalists praised, and what example is given regarding spiritual masters, in the purport of Gita 6.42?", "answer": "The purport praises this birth because the child receives spiritual impetus from life's beginning, especially in acarya or gosvami families, who are learned and devoted by tradition and training, becoming spiritual masters.

Different methods: karma-yoga (fruitive), jnana-yoga (empirical), bhakti-yoga (devotional relationship). Bhakti-yoga (Krsna consciousness) is ultimate perfection of all yogas. Lord confirms yoga's superiority but not over bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga is full spiritual knowledge, excelling all.

'Worship' (adore, show respect) is not the same. Service with love and faith is for Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man/demigod (discourteous), but cannot avoid serving Supreme Lord without condemnation. Every living entity constitutionally serves Supreme; failing this, they fall. Bhagavatam (11.5.3) confirms this using 'bhajanti'.

This complete knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord directly from the Lord in disciplic succession.

{"question": "Why is it very difficult for nondevotees to know Krsna, even if they have transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman, according to the purport of Gita 7.3?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna is the Supreme Person, beyond Brahman and Paramatma knowledge. Yogis and jnanis are confused. Even Sankaracarya admitted Krsna is Supreme, but his followers don't accept it. Although nondevotees claim bhakti is easy, they can't practice it properly. Real bhakti, according to rules, makes speculative scholars fall away. They cannot understand Krsna as Yasoda's son or Arjuna's charioteer.

{"question": "What is the distinction between living entities and the Lord, as described in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.87.30) quoted in the purport of Gita 7.5?", "answer": "The purport quotes Bhagavatam (10.87.30): If embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like God, they wouldn't be under His control. If accepted as minute energies, they are subject to His supreme control. Real liberation is surrendering to His control, making them happy.

{"question": "How is the material body developed, and similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation, according to the purport of Gita 7.6?", "answer": "The purport explains spirit is the basic field of creation; matter is created by spirit. The material body develops because spirit is present within matter; a child grows due to the superior energy (spirit soul) being present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe develops because of the presence of the Supersoul, Visnu. Spirit and matter are originally two energies of the Lord, so He is the original cause.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "6"}

{"question": "What is Lord Caitanya's sublime doctrine mentioned in the purport of Gita 7.8, regarding the personal and impersonal conceptions of God?", "answer": "The purport states that one who knows God knows that impersonal and personal conceptions are simultaneously present in everything without contradiction.

Everything in the material world has an uncontaminated, original flavor/fragrance, which is Krsna. In Krsna consciousness, we become aware that earth, water, fire, air, every active principle, all chemicals and material elements are due to Krsna. Man's life duration is also due to Krsna; by His grace, man can prolong or diminish it. Krsna consciousness is active in every sphere.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "9"}
{"question": "What does Krsna declare Himself to be in relation to all existences, the intelligent, and the powerful, in Bhagavad Gita 7.10?", "answer": "Krsna declares in Gita 7.10: 'O son of Prtha (partha), know that I am the original seed of all existences (bijam mam sarva-bhutanam viddhi sanatanam), the intelligence of the intelligent (buddhir buddhimatam asmi), and the prowess of all powerful men (tejas tejasvinam aham).'", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "10"}
{"question": "How does Krsna, as the original root, maintain everything in the material manifestation, according to the purport of Gita 7.10?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna is the seed (bijam) of everything. Brahman (Supreme Absolute Truth) is that from which everything emanates. Krsna is Parabrahman, the Supreme Spirit. Krsna is the source of everything, the root.

{"question": "Why is Krsna called 'nirguna', and how does this relate to His being subject to material modes, according to the purport of Gita 7.12?", "answer": "The purport explains all material activities are under the three material modes, which emanate from Krsna.

{"question": "How do people get entangled with material nature's modes and forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead, according to the purport of Gita 7.13?", "answer": "The purport explains everyone in the material world is under the influence of the three gunas and thus bewildered. By nature, living entities have particular body types and psychic/biological activities. Due to the spell of illusory energy, we consider ourselves by this bodily conception (American, Indian, brahmana, Hindu, etc.).

{"question": "Are these four types of men pure devotees, and when can they become pure devotees, according to the purport of Gita 7.16?", "answer": "The purport states these are not pure devotees because they have aspirations to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration or material profit desire (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11).

Further advanced, one understands spiritual life has activities: devotional service. Realizing this, one attaches to Supreme Personality and surrenders. Then one understands Krsna's mercy is everything, He's cause of all causes, material manifestation isn't independent. Realizing everything relates to Krsna (Vasudeva), this universal vision precipitates full surrender to Lord Krsna as highest goal.

{"question": "Why do less intelligent people generally not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for immediate fulfillment of material desires, and what does a pure devotee do, according to the purport of Gita 7.20?", "answer": "The purport explains less intelligent people with lost spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate material desires. They usually don't go to Supreme Lord because they are in particular modes (ignorance/passion), so worship various demigods, satisfied by following rules. They are motivated by small desires, not knowing how to reach supreme goal.

{"question": "Why does the all-powerful God give facilities to living entities for material enjoyment, letting them fall into illusory energy's trap, as per the purport of Gita 7.21?", "answer": "The purport explains God gives everyone independence. If Supreme Lord as Supersoul doesn't give facilities for material desires, then independence has no meaning. He gives full independence for whatever one likes, but His ultimate instruction is to surrender fully to Him, which makes man happy. Both living entity and demigods are subordinate to Supreme's will.

{"question": "Why does a living entity usually go to demigods, and what is contradictory about one who worships the Supreme Lord while desiring material enjoyment, as per the purport of Gita 7.22?", "answer": "The purport explains a living entity usually goes to demigods because he is mad to fulfill his lust, when something undue is desired and the Lord Himself doesn't fulfill it. Caitanya-caritamrta says one worshiping Supreme Lord and simultaneously desiring material enjoyment is contradictory. Demigod worship is material; Supreme Lord's devotional service is spiritual.

{"question": "Why are worshippers of demigods less intelligent, even if demigods are parts of the Supreme Lord, as per the purport of Gita 7.23?", "answer": "The purport explains worshipers of demigods are less intelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food must be supplied (like trying to feed body via ears/eyes). They don't know demigods are parts of Supreme Lord's universal body and ignorantly believe each demigod is a separate, competing God.

{"question": "How is Krsna's body unlike an ordinary human's regarding remembrance and change, and what is stated about maya covering Him, as per the purport of Gita 7.26?", "answer": "The purport explains if Krsna were material (maya), He'd change body and forget past, like ordinary humans. But Krsna clearly says He knows past, present, future (e.g., instructing Vivasvan millions of years ago). His transcendental body isn't perishable. He's like sun; maya is like cloud.

Deluded into separation from this, one is controlled by illusory energy, cannot understand Supreme. Illusory energy manifests in duality of desire and hate. Due to desire/hate, ignorant person wants to become one with Supreme, envies Krsna as Supreme. Pure devotees, not so deluded, understand Krsna appears by internal potencies.

One attaining spiritual body, becoming Lord's associate in eternal devotional service, is liberated. 'Aham brahmasmi' (I am spirit) is this Brahman conception.

{"question": "How is the Lord always neutral in the material activities of the created world, similar to a high court judge, as per the purport of Gita 9.9?", "answer": "The purport explains the Supreme Lord isn't unengaged; He's always in eternal, blissful, spiritual activities, but has nothing to do with material activities (carried on by His potencies). He's neutral like a high court judge: by his order things happen (hanging, jailing, awarding wealth), but he's neutral, unconcerned with gain/loss. Similarly, Lord is neutral, though His hand is in every sphere. He's transcendental to material dualities, not attached to creation/annihilation.

He simply glances over material nature; it's activated, everything created immediately. Example from smrti: a fragrant flower before someone; fragrance touched by smelling power, yet smelling and flower are detached.

Fools deride Him as man because He acts like one (Arjuna's friend, politician). His body is 'manusim' because He acts like man, but actually it's sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (eternal bliss, knowledge absolute).

{"question": "What false conclusion do miscreants who mock Krsna come to, and why will their attempt to become one with Krsna be baffled, according to the purport of Gita 9.12?", "answer": "The purport explains many assuming Krsna consciousness don't accept Krsna as Absolute Truth; for them, going back to Godhead won't be tasted. Those in fruitive activities hoping for liberation also fail if they deride Krsna. Mockers are demonic/atheistic, never surrender. Mental speculations lead to false conclusion: ordinary living entity and Krsna are one and same.

This is effected by surrendering to Supreme Personality, Sri Krsna (as per Chapter Seven), freeing one from material nature's control. This is preliminary formula. Freed from material nature, living entity is put under spiritual nature's guidance (daivi prakrti). Promoted thus by surrender, one attains mahatma stage.

{"question": "Who are the three types of lower worshippers of Krsna mentioned in the purport of Gita 9.15, and which is most predominant?", "answer": "The purport explains some not exactly mahatmas worship Krsna differently. Besides distressed, destitute, inquisitive, knowledge cultivators, there are lower ones in three types: 1) Worshipper of self as one with Supreme Lord (monist mentality) - most predominant.

One not knowing Krsna is misled. Many aim for demigods, reaching planets like Candraloka, Suryaloka via rigid methods. These planets, Krsna's creations/energy manifestations, are Krsna and not Krsna, serving as steps to realize Krsna. Approaching Krsna's different energies is indirect approach.

He checks/gives rain. Energy sustaining life is Krsna; Krsna is also death. Analyzing these energies shows Krsna is both matter and spirit. In advanced Krsna consciousness, no such distinctions are made; one sees Krsna only in everything.

Example: pouring water on tree leaves/branches without watering root is done without sufficient knowledge/regulative principles. Similarly, serving body parts means supplying food to stomach. Demigods are officers in Supreme Lord's government. One follows government laws, not officers'. Worship should be to Supreme Lord only; this satisfies His officers.

{"question": "What foods should not be offered to Krsna, and what are the proper foods prescribed by Him, according to the purport of Gita 9.26?", "answer": "The purport explains one wishing devotional service should find out what Lord desires. One loving Krsna gives what He wants, avoids undesirable/unasked. Meat, fish, eggs should not be offered. If He desired them, He'd have said so. He clearly requests leaf, fruit, flowers, water. So, He won't accept meat, fish, eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk, water are proper foods for humans, prescribed by Krsna. Other foods can't be offered; He won't accept.

{"question": "Why did Arjuna address Krsna as air and grandfather, as explained in the purport of Gita 11.39?", "answer": "The purport explains Lord addressed as air because air is most important representation of all demigods, being all-pervasive.

Admitted not knowing Krsna could assume such form, though Krsna explained as intimate friend. Arjuna didn't know how many times he dishonored Krsna by informal address without acknowledging opulence. Krsna so kind/merciful, despite opulence played with Arjuna as friend. This is transcendental loving reciprocation. Living entity-Krsna relationship fixed eternally, cannot be forgotten (Arjuna's behavior shows this).

He's spiritual master because He originally gave Vedic instructions to Brahma, and now Gita to Arjuna. Any bona fide spiritual master now must be descendant in disciplic succession from Krsna.

Knew Arjuna not interested in four-handed form, but showed it as asked, then showed two-handed form. 'Saumya-vapuh' very significant: very beautiful form, most beautiful. When present, everyone attracted by Krsna's form. Krsna (universe director) banished Arjuna's fear, showed beautiful Krsna form again.

Those deriding Krsna as ordinary are ignorant of His divine nature. If Krsna ordinary human, how could He show universal and four-handed Narayana forms?

Verse explicitly states this against speculative commentators. Word 'tu' specifically indicates no other process can be used/recommended/successful in understanding Krsna. Krsna's personal forms (two-handed Krsna, four-handed Narayana) completely different from temporary universal form. Four-handed Narayana, two-handed Krsna are eternal/transcendental; universal form temporary. 'Sudurdarsam' (difficult to see) suggests no one saw universal form before, no necessity among devotees.

Civilized method for needed fat by milk. Slaughter subhuman way. Protein amply available via split peas, dal, whole wheat.
