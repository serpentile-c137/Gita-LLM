{"question": "Why is the phrase 'yoga-balena' significant, and what is recommended for those who do not practice such yoga, as per the purport of Gita 8.10?", "answer": "The purport explains 'yoga-balena' is significant because without yoga practice one cannot reach this transcendental state at death. One cannot suddenly remember the Supreme Lord unless practiced in some yoga system, especially bhakti-yoga. For a pure devotee not practicing such yoga, the mind should always be engaged in Krsna consciousness so at death he can remember Supreme by His grace.

As people on earth are elevated, those on higher planets (Brahmaloka, Candraloka, Indraloka) fall to earth.
