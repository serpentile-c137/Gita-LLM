{"question": "What is certain to be present wherever there is Krsna, the master of all mystics, and Arjuna, the supreme archer, according to Sanjaya's opinion in Bhagavad Gita 18.78?", "answer": "Sanjaya opined in Gita 18.78: 'Wherever (yatra) there is Krsna (krsno), the master of all mystics (yogesvarah), and wherever there is Arjuna (yatra partho), the supreme archer (dhanur-dharah), there will also certainly be opulence (tatra srir), victory (vijayo), extraordinary power (bhutir), and morality (dhruva nitir). That is my opinion (matir mama).'", "source_chapter": "18", "source_verse": "78"}
{"question": "What did Sanjaya predict about the outcome of the battle and the future of Yudhisthira, based on Krsna and Arjuna's presence, as per the purport of Gita 18.78?", "answer": "The purport explains Gita began with Dhrtarastra's inquiry, hopeful of sons' victory (assisted by Bhisma, Drona, Karna). After describing battlefield scene, Sanjaya told King: 'You thinking of victory, but my opinion where Krsna/Arjuna present, all good fortune there.' Directly confirmed Dhrtarastra couldn't expect victory. Victory certain for Arjuna's side (Krsna there). Krsna as Arjuna's charioteer exhibition of another opulence (renunciation, one of six). Krsna master of renunciation. Fight actually between Duryodhana/Yudhisthira. Arjuna fighting for elder brother Yudhisthira. Krsna/Arjuna on Yudhisthira's side, his victory certain. Battle to decide world ruler; Sanjaya predicted power transfer to Yudhisthira. Also predicted Yudhisthira, after victory, would flourish more (righteous, pious, strict moralist, never lied).", "source_chapter": "18", "source_verse": "78"}
