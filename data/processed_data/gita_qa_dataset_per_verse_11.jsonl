Admitted not knowing Krsna could assume such form, though Krsna explained as intimate friend. Arjuna didn't know how many times he dishonored Krsna by informal address without acknowledging opulence. Krsna so kind/merciful, despite opulence played with Arjuna as friend. This is transcendental loving reciprocation.

Verse explicitly states this against speculative commentators. Word 'tu' specifically indicates no other process can be used/recommended/successful in understanding Krsna. Krsna's personal forms (two-handed Krsna, four-handed Narayana) completely different from temporary universal form. Four-handed Narayana, two-handed Krsna are eternal/transcendental; universal form temporary. 'Sudurdarsam' (difficult to see) suggests no one saw universal form before, no necessity among devotees.
