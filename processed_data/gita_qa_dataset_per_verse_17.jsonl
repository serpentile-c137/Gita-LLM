Adopted for living entity's ultimate liberation. All such activities, recommended to vibrate om tat sat. 'Sad-bhave' and 'sadhu-bhave' indicate transcendental situation. One acting in Krsna consciousness called sattva; one fully conscious of Krsna consciousness activities called sadhu. Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.25.25): transcendental subject matter becomes clear in devotees association. Without good association, cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. Initiating person/offering sacred thread, one vibrates om tat sat. Similarly, all yajna kinds performances, supreme object om tat sat invoked. These words om tat sat used to perfect all activities.

{"question": "What is the nature and utility of sacrifices, austerities, and charities performed without faith in the Supreme ('asraddhaya'), according to Bhagavad Gita 17.28?", "answer": "Gita 17.28 states: 'But sacrifices (hutam), austerities (tapas taptam) and charities (dattam) performed without faith in the Supreme (asraddhaya) are nonpermanent (krtam ca yat asad ity ucyate), O son of Prtha (partha), regardless of whatever rites are performed. They are called asat and are useless both in this life (no iha) and the next (na ca tat pretya).'", "source_chapter": "17", "source_verse": "28"}
{"question": "What is the ultimate goal in the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, and what is the best course for making everything successful, according to the purport of Gita 17.28?", "answer": "The purport explains anything done without transcendental objective (sacrifice, charity, penance) is useless. Verse declares such activities abominable. Everything for Supreme in Krsna consciousness. Without such faith, proper guidance, never any fruit. All Vedic scriptures, faith in Supreme advised. Pursuit of all Vedic instructions, ultimate goal understanding Krsna. No success without following this principle. Best course: work from very beginning in Krsna consciousness under bona fide spiritual master guidance. Way to make everything successful. Conditional state: people attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, Yaksas (Kuvera). Goodness mode better than passion/ignorance; one taking directly to Krsna consciousness transcendental to all three material nature modes. Gradual elevation process exists; if by pure devotees association, one takes directly to Krsna consciousness, best way. Recommended this chapter. To succeed this way, first find proper spiritual master, receive training. Then achieve Supreme faith. Faith matures, becomes love of God. Love ultimate goal. Take Krsna consciousness directly.
