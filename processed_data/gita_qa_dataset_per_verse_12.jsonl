{"question": "Why is jnana-yoga troublesome while bhakti-yoga is easier and natural for the embodied soul, and how does Deity worship (arca-vigraha) facilitate this, as per the purport of Gita 12.5?", "answer": "The purport contrasts jnana-yogis (impersonal path) and bhakti-yogis (direct service to Supreme). Jnana-yoga, though leading to same goal, very troublesome. Bhakti-yoga (direct service) easier, natural for embodied soul (embodied since time immemorial, hard to theoretically grasp not body). Bhakti-yogi accepts Krsna Deity as worshipable; bodily conception fixed in mind can thus be applied. Worship of Deity (arca-vigraha, authorized representation) not idol worship. Lord omnipotent, via arca-vigraha incarnation, accepts devotee's service, convenient for conditioned man.

In pure devotional service, one realizes God is great, soul subordinate. Duty is to serve Lord; if not, serve maya. Lord Himself takes devotee.

Second class follows prescribed rules to elevate to Krsna attachment. Bhakti-yoga is sense purification. Now senses impure, in sense gratification. Bhakti-yoga purifies them; in purified state, they contact Supreme Lord directly. Love of God dormant in everyone's heart, contaminated by material association. Purify material association, revive natural love for Krsna. Regulative principles under expert spiritual master: rise early, bathe, temple, prayers, chant Hare Krsna, collect flowers for Deity, cook for Deity, take prasadam, etc. Constantly hear Gita/Bhagavatam from pure devotees.

By giving up fruit of actions, one surely purifies mind gradually; in purified mind state, able to understand Krsna consciousness. Krsna consciousness itself can purify mind, but if impediments, try giving up action results.
