{"question": "What happens to one who engages in full devotional service ('bhakti-yogena sevate') without falling down, in relation to the modes of material nature and the level of Brahman, according to Bhagavad Gita 14.26?", "answer": "Gita 14.26 states: 'One who engages in full devotional service (yah avyabhicarena bhakti-yogena sevate), who does not fall down in any circumstance (mam ca), at once transcends the modes of material nature (sa gunan samatityaitan) and thus comes to the level of Brahman (brahma-bhuyaya kalpate).'", "source_chapter": "14", "source_verse": "26"}
{"question": "What are Krsna activities, and what is the qualification to be a personal assistant to a king, analogous to serving the Supreme Lord, as per the purport of Gita 14.26?", "answer": "The purport answers Arjuna's third question (means to attain transcendental position). Material world acts under modes spell. Not disturbed by modes activities; transfer consciousness to Krsna activities (bhakti-yoga - always acting for Krsna, including His expansions Rama/Narayana). All Krsna forms fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge, eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, possess all transcendental qualities. Engaging in service of Krsna/His expansions with unfailing determination, can overcome modes easily (Ch.7: one surrendering to Krsna surmounts modes influence). Krsna consciousness/devotional service means acquiring equality with Krsna. Lord's nature eternal, blissful, full of knowledge; living entities part/parcel of Supreme (like gold particles part of gold mine). Living entity's spiritual position as good as gold, Krsna in quality. Individuality continues (else no bhakti-yoga: Lord, devotee, love exchange activity). To be personal assistant to king, must acquire qualifications. Qualification is becoming Brahman (freed from material contamination). Vedic: 'brahmaiva san brahmapy eti' (attain Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman). Means qualitatively one with Brahman. Attaining Brahman, not lose eternal Brahman identity as individual soul.", "source_chapter": "14", "source_verse": "26"}
{"question": "Of what is Krsna the basis ('pratisthaham'), according to His statement in Bhagavad Gita 14.27?", "answer": "Krsna states in Gita 14.27: 'And I am the basis of impersonal Brahman (brahmano hi pratisthaham), which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness (sukhasyaikantikasya ca), and which is immortal (amrtasya), imperishable (avyayasya ca) and eternal (sasvatasya ca dharmasya).'", "source_chapter": "14", "source_verse": "27"}
{"question": "What are the stages of transcendental realization, and what is the risk for one who cannot elevate beyond the impersonal Brahman conception, as per the purport of Gita 14.27?", "answer": "The purport explains Brahman constitution: immortality, imperishability, eternity, happiness. Brahman beginning of transcendental realization. Paramatma (Supersoul) middle, second stage. Supreme Personality of Godhead ultimate Absolute Truth realization. Paramatma and impersonal Brahman within Supreme Person. (Ch.7: material nature is Lord's inferior energy. Lord impregnates it with superior nature fragments - spiritual touch). Conditioned living entity cultivating spiritual knowledge elevates from material existence, gradually rises to Brahman conception (first stage self-realization). Brahman-realized person transcendental, but not actually perfect. Can stay in Brahman position, then gradually rise to Paramatma realization, then Supreme Personality realization (e.g. four Kumaras). One not elevating beyond impersonal Brahman conception risks falling down. Srimad-Bhagavatam: person rising to impersonal Brahman, without going further (no Supreme Person info), intelligence not perfectly clear. Despite Brahman platform, chance of falling if not in Lord's devotional service.", "source_chapter": "14", "source_verse": "27"}
