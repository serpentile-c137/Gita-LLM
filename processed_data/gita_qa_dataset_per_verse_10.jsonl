Lord is different; conditioned souls change bodies, His body isn't changeable. He comes as same unborn, by internal potency, not under inferior material energy. Demigods were created in material world; Krsna isn't created, thus different even from Brahma/Siva. He's their creator, Supreme Person.

Truth should be spoken straightforwardly, even if unpalatable. 'Ahimsa' (nonviolence) means not doing anything to put others into misery/confusion.

Arjuna, as Vaisnava/devotee, asks out of mercy for understanding of all mankind.
