Material conception: demigod, human, dog, cat, etc. - material vision, not actual. Material differentiation due to material conception. After material body destruction, spirit soul is one.

Consciousness not material combination product; symptom of living entity. Living entity's consciousness qualitatively one with supreme consciousness, but not supreme (consciousness of one body doesn't share another's).
