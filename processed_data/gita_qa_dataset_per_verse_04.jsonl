{"question": "For what purpose is the science of Bhagavad-gita especially meant, and who is obliged to impart this lesson to citizens, as per the purport of Gita 4.1?", "answer": "The purport states this science is especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants.

{"question": "How was the supreme science of yoga received and understood by saintly kings ('rajarsayo'), and what happened to it in the course of time, as stated in Bhagavad Gita 4.2?", "answer": "Gita 4.2 states: 'This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession (evam parampara-praptam imam), and the saintly kings understood it in that way (rajarsayo viduh). But in course of time (sa kaleneha mahata) the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost (yogo nastah parantapa).'", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "2"}
{"question": "Why was there a need to reestablish the disciplic succession for Bhagavad-gita, according to the purport of Gita 4.2?", "answer": "The purport explains that as soon as the original purpose of the Gita was scattered by the motives of unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago, the Lord Himself detected the succession was broken. Similarly, at present, many editions are not according to authorized disciplic succession, with mundane scholars offering interpretations but not accepting Krsna as the Supreme Personality.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "2"}
{"question": "Why was the ancient science of yoga ('yogah puratanah') told by Krsna to Arjuna, as explained in Bhagavad Gita 4.3?", "answer": "Krsna explained in Gita 4.3: 'That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by Me to you (sa evayam maya te 'dya yogah proktah puratanah) because you are My devotee (bhakto 'si me) as well as My friend (sakha ceti); therefore you can understand the transcendental mystery of this science (rahasyam hy etad uttamam).'", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "3"}
{"question": "Who are the two classes of men, and for whom is it possible to understand the great mysterious science of Bhagavad-gita, according to the purport of Gita 4.3?", "answer": "The purport states there are two classes: the devotee and the demon.

One should follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "3"}
{"question": "What was Arjuna's question to Krsna in Bhagavad Gita 4.4, regarding Krsna's instruction of yoga to Vivasvan?", "answer": "Arjuna asked: 'The sun-god Vivasvan (param janma vivasvatah) is senior by birth to You (aparam bhavato janma).

{"question": "For whom was Arjuna actually inquiring when he questioned Krsna's seniority to Vivasvan, according to the purport of Gita 4.4?", "answer": "The purport explains Arjuna was not inquiring for himself (as an accepted devotee) but for those who do not believe in Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or for demons who dislike this idea.

{"question": "What is the difference between the Lord and the part-and-parcel living entity like Arjuna regarding remembrance of past births, as explained in the purport of Gita 4.5?", "answer": "The purport states the Lord remembered incidents from millions of years ago, whereas Arjuna, despite being a mighty hero and constant companion, could not. A living entity, however great, can never equal the Supreme Lord. The Lord (Acyuta) never forgets Himself, even in material contact, because He doesn't change His sac-cid-ananda body, unlike the conditioned soul who forgets due to changing bodies.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "5"}
{"question": "How does Lord Krsna describe His appearance in every millennium in Bhagavad Gita 4.6, despite being unborn and having an imperishable body?", "answer": "Lord Krsna says in Gita 4.6: 'Although I am unborn (ajo 'pi sann) and My transcendental body never deteriorates (avyayatma), and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings (bhutanam isvaro 'pi san), I still appear in every millennium (sambhavamy) in My original transcendental form (prakrtim svam adhisthaya atma-mayaya).'", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "6"}
{"question": "How is Krsna's appearance and disappearance like the sun's rising and setting, according to the purport of Gita 4.6?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna's appearance and disappearance is like the sun's. When the sun is out of sight, we think it has set; when before our eyes, we think it's on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always fixed.

{"question": "How does the liberation achieved by a devotee differ from that of impersonalists and yogis, according to the purport of Gita 4.9?", "answer": "The purport explains impersonalists and yogis attain liberation (merging into brahmajyoti) after much trouble and many births, but it's only partial with risk of returning to the material world. A devotee, simply by understanding the Lord's transcendental nature and activities, attains the Lord's abode after this body and doesn't risk returning.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "9"}

{"question": "How does Krsna reciprocate with different types of worshippers, including pure devotees, impersonalists, and fruitive workers, according to the purport of Gita 4.11?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna reciprocates according to one's desire. Pure devotees associate with Him personally, rendering service and deriving transcendental bliss.

God is one (Krsna/Narayana/Visnu); parts are many. Demigods are living entities with material power. Anyone who thinks God and demigods are on the same level is an atheist or 'pasandi'. Even Brahma and Siva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "12"}
{"question": "How were the four divisions of human society ('catur-varnyam') created by Krsna, and what is His position regarding this system, as stated in Bhagavad Gita 4.13?", "answer": "Krsna states in Gita 4.13: 'According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them (guna-karma-vibhagasah), the four divisions of human society were created by Me (catur-varnyam maya srstam).

One who understands this truth about Me (iti mam yo 'bhijanati) also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work (karmabhir na sa badhyate).'", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "14"}
{"question": "Why is the Lord not affected by material activities, unlike living entities, according to the purport of Gita 4.14?", "answer": "The purport explains the Lord, though creator, is aloof from creation's activities, like a king not subject to state laws. Living entities are entangled in fruitive results due to their propensity for lording over material resources and sense gratification. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for such things. He only gives facilities; living entities are responsible for their own acts.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "14"}

{"question": "Is it better to retire from Krsna conscious activities or engage in them for Krsna's sake, according to the purport of Gita 4.15?", "answer": "The purport states that retiring from Krsna conscious activities and making a show of Krsna consciousness is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for Krsna's sake.

{"question": "Why did the Lord decide to instruct Arjuna directly in Krsna consciousness, as per the purport of Gita 4.16?", "answer": "The purport explains one has to follow previous authorities in disciplic succession; otherwise, even intelligent men will be bewildered. The Lord decided to instruct Arjuna directly so that anyone following Arjuna's footsteps would not be bewildered.

{"question": "What three things should one understand properly due to the difficulty of their intricacies, as mentioned in Bhagavad Gita 4.17?", "answer": "Gita 4.17 states: 'The intricacies of action are very hard to understand (gahana karmano gatih).

{"question": "Who is considered intelligent among men ('sa buddhiman manusyesu') and in the transcendental position, according to Bhagavad Gita 4.18?", "answer": "Gita 4.18 states: 'One who sees inaction in action (karmany akarma yah pasyed), and action in inaction (akarmani ca karma yah), is intelligent among men (sa buddhiman manusyesu), and he is in the transcendental position (sa yuktah), although engaged in all sorts of activities (krtsna-karma-krt).'", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "18"}
{"question": "What does 'akarma' mean, and how does a person acting in Krsna consciousness achieve this state, as per the purport of Gita 4.18?", "answer": "The purport explains 'akarma' means without reaction to work. A person acting in Krsna consciousness is naturally free from karma's bonds because all activities are for Krsna; they don't enjoy or suffer work's effects. The sense of eternal servitorship to Krsna makes one immune to all reactionary elements of work.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "18"}
{"question": "Who is understood to be in full knowledge ('panditam budhah'), and what happens to their fruitive action, according to Bhagavad Gita 4.19?", "answer": "Gita 4.19 states: 'One is understood to be in full knowledge (tam ahuh panditam budhah) whose every act (yasya sarve samarambhah) is devoid of desire for sense gratification (kama-sankalpa-varjitah).

{"question": "What is the development of knowledge of eternal servitorship to the Lord compared to, and what can it do, as per the purport of Gita 4.19?", "answer": "The purport compares the development of this knowledge to fire.

{"question": "How does a man of understanding act, and is he affected by sinful reactions when working only for bare necessities, as per Bhagavad Gita 4.21?", "answer": "Gita 4.21 states: 'Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly controlled (nirasir yata-cittatma), gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions (tyakta-sarva-parigrahah) and acts only for the bare necessities of life (sariram kevalam karma kurvan).

They are dovetailed with the supreme desire, having no desire for personal sense gratification, moving like a machine part. Like an animal having no proprietorship over its body (even if a cruel owner kills it, it doesn't protest), the Krsna conscious person, engaged in self-realization, has little time to falsely possess material objects and doesn't use unfair means, thus remaining free from material sins and reactions.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "21"}

{"question": "How does a Krsna conscious person handle duality like heat/cold or misery/happiness, and why are they steady in success and failure, as per the purport of Gita 4.22?", "answer": "The purport explains a Krsna conscious person is above duality because they don't hesitate to act in any way for Krsna's satisfaction.

{"question": "How does one become freed from dualities and material mode contaminations, according to the purport of Gita 4.23?", "answer": "The purport states that by becoming fully Krsna conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus from the contaminations of the material modes. This liberation happens because they know their constitutional position in relationship with Krsna, and their mind cannot be drawn from Krsna consciousness.

{"question": "What is 'Brahman' and 'brahmajyoti', and how does Krsna consciousness convert illusory consciousness into Brahman, according to the purport of Gita 4.24?", "answer": "The purport explains 'Brahman' means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are 'brahmajyoti,' His spiritual effulgence. Everything exists in brahmajyoti. When jyoti is covered by illusion (maya) or sense gratification, it's material. Krsna consciousness is the process of converting illusory consciousness into Brahman (the Supreme).

'Tapomaya-yajna' is voluntarily accepting austerities like candrayana or caturmasya (not shaving for 4 months, restricted eating, not leaving home) for higher elevation or promotion to higher planets. It's sacrificing life's comforts.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "28"}
{"question": "Describe the different breath control practices some individuals undertake as a form of sacrifice, as detailed in Bhagavad Gita 4.29.", "answer": "Gita 4.29 states: 'And there are even others who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance (pranayama-parayanah), and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing breath (pranam) into the incoming (apane juhvati), and incoming breath (apanam) into the outgoing (prane tathapare), and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing (pranapana-gati ruddhva). Some of them, curtailing the eating process (apare niyataharah), offer the outgoing breath into itself, as a sacrifice (pranan pranesu juhvati).'", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "29"}
{"question": "What is 'pranayama', 'puraka', 'recaka', and 'kumbhaka-yoga' as explained in the purport of Gita 4.29, and how does a Krsna conscious person differ in approach?", "answer": "The purport explains 'pranayama' is controlling the breathing process (practiced in hatha-yoga). Apana air goes down, prana up. Yogi practices breathing oppositely until currents neutralize into 'puraka' (equilibrium). Offering exhaled breath to inhaled is 'recaka'. When both air currents stop, it's 'kumbhaka-yoga', increasing longevity. A Krsna conscious person, always in transcendental loving service, automatically controls senses and is transferred to Krsna's abode, not attempting to increase longevity.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "29"}

{"question": "What is the common aim of all different types of sacrifice, and what platform does one need to reach to be elevated to the eternal platform, as per the purport of Gita 4.30?", "answer": "The purport states the common aim of all sacrifices is to control the senses. Sense gratification is the root of material existence. Unless one is on a platform apart from sense gratification, there's no chance of elevation to the eternal platform of full knowledge, bliss, and life (Brahman atmosphere).

{"question": "How does the path of religion or yajna solve economic problems and lead to liberation, according to the purport of Gita 4.31?", "answer": "The purport explains the human form is a loophole to escape material entanglement. Vedas give paths of religion (yajna), economic comfort, regulated sense gratification, and liberation. Performing yajna solves economic problems (enough food, milk).

{"question": "Why are different types of sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas, as per the purport of Gita 4.32?", "answer": "The purport explains different sacrifices are mentioned in the Vedas to suit different types of workers. Because men are so deeply absorbed in the bodily concept, these sacrifices are arranged so one can work with the body, mind, or intelligence. All are recommended for ultimately bringing liberation from the body.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "32"}
{"question": "Which sacrifice is greater than the sacrifice of material possessions, and in what does the sacrifice of work culminate, according to Bhagavad Gita 4.33?", "answer": "Gita 4.33 states: 'O chastiser of the enemy (parantapa), the sacrifice of knowledge (jnana-yajnah) is greater (sreyan) than the sacrifice of material possessions (dravya-mayad yajnat).

{"question": "How should one try to learn the truth ('tad viddhi'), and who can impart knowledge ('upadeksyanti te jnanam'), according to Bhagavad Gita 4.34?", "answer": "Gita 4.34 advises: 'Just try to learn the truth (tad viddhi) by approaching a spiritual master (pranipatena). Inquire from him submissively (pariprasnena) and render service unto him (sevaya).

{"question": "What constitutes the proper combination for spiritual understanding from a spiritual master, and what is condemned in Gita 4.34, according to its purport?", "answer": "The purport states inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must pass the spiritual master's test. Blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One must hear submissively, get clear understanding via submission, service, and inquiries.

The whole teaching of the Gita is targeted toward this end: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be separated from Krsna, and his sense of being an identity apart from Krsna is maya. Living entities, as separate parts, have a purpose to fulfill; forgetting it, they are in different bodies due to forgetfulness of the Lord's transcendental service.", "source_chapter": "4", "source_verse": "35"}
