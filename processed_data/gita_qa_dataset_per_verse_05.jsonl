{"question": "In Bhagavad Gita 5.1, what was Arjuna's confusion regarding Krsna's instructions about renouncing work versus work with devotion, and what did he ask for?", "answer": "Arjuna said: 'O Krsna (krsna), first of all You ask me to renounce work (sannyasam karmanam), and then again You recommend work with devotion (punar yogam ca samsasi). Now will You kindly tell me definitely (tan me bruhi su-niscitam) which of the two is more beneficial (yac chreya etayor ekam)?'", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "1"}
{"question": "What did Arjuna understand renunciation in knowledge to involve, and how did this seem incompatible with work in devotional service, according to the purport of Gita 5.1?", "answer": "The purport explains Arjuna understood renunciation in knowledge (sannyasa) involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. He thought work and renunciation were incompatible because if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? He didn't understand that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and thus the same as inaction.", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "1"}
{"question": "What did Sri Bhagavan state in Bhagavad Gita 5.2 about the renunciation of work ('sannyasah') and work in devotion ('karma-yogah') in terms of liberation, and which is better?", "answer": "The Blessed Lord said: 'The renunciation of work (sannyasah) and work in devotion (karma-yogas ca) are both good for liberation (nihsreyasa-karav ubhau). But, of the two, work in devotional service (karma-yogo) is better than renunciation of works (tayos tu karma-sannyasat visisyate).'", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "2"}
{"question": "Why is jnana (knowledge that one is spirit soul) not sufficient for liberation, and why is action in Krsna consciousness superior to mere renunciation, according to the purport of Gita 5.2?", "answer": "The purport explains jnana alone isn't sufficient; one has to act as spirit soul to escape material bondage. Action in Krsna consciousness isn't fruitive and strengthens real knowledge. Mere renunciation without Krsna consciousness doesn't purify the heart; one must still work fruitively. Action in Krsna consciousness helps escape fruitive results and is superior to renunciation, which risks falling. Renunciation is complete when one knows everything is Krsna's and should be used in His service.", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "2"}
{"question": "Who is known to be always renounced ('nitya-sannyasi') and easily overcomes material bondage, according to Bhagavad Gita 5.3?", "answer": "Gita 5.3 states: 'One who neither hates (yo na dvesti) nor desires the fruits of his activities (na kanksati) is known to be always renounced (jneyah sa nitya-sannyasi).

{"question": "Why is a person fully in Krsna consciousness always a renouncer, and what kind of knowledge do they possess, as per the purport of Gita 5.3?", "answer": "The purport explains one in Krsna consciousness is always a renouncer because they feel neither hatred nor desire for action's results. Dedicated to the Lord's transcendental loving service, they are fully qualified in knowledge, knowing their constitutional position: Krsna is the whole, and they are part and parcel. This knowledge is perfect (one in quality, different in quantity), leading to fullness without aspiration or lamentation, free from duality.", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "3"}
{"question": "Who speaks of devotional service (karma-yoga) as being different from the analytical study of the material world (Sankhya), and what do the learned ('panditah') say, according to Bhagavad Gita 5.4?", "answer": "Gita 5.4 states: 'Only the ignorant (balah) speak of devotional service [karma-yoga] (yogau) as being different (prthak) from the analytical study of the material world [Sankhya] (sankhya).

{"question": "What is the aim of analytical study (Sankhya) and devotional service (karma-yoga), and why is there no essential difference between the two, according to the purport of Gita 5.4?", "answer": "The purport explains the aim of analytical study is to find the soul of existence, which is Visnu (Supersoul). Devotional service entails service to the Supersoul. One process finds the root (Visnu); the other waters it. A real Sankhya student finds Visnu and engages in His service. Thus, the aim of both is Visnu, so there's no difference. Only those who don't know the ultimate end say they are different.", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "4"}

{"question": "How are the processes of Sankhya (detachment from matter) and devotional yoga (attachment to Krsna's work) factually the same, as per the purport of Gita 5.5?", "answer": "The purport explains the real purpose of philosophical research (Sankhya) is self-realization. Sankhya concludes the living entity is part of the supreme spirit, his actions must relate to the Supreme. Devotional yoga involves acting in Krsna consciousness, one's constitutional position. Sankhya involves detachment from matter; devotional yoga involves attachment to Krsna's work. Detachment from matter and attachment to Krsna are one and the same.", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "5"}
{"question": "What is difficult to attain without devotional service ('ayogatah'), and who can achieve the Supreme without delay, according to Bhagavad Gita 5.6?", "answer": "Gita 5.6 states: 'Merely renouncing all activities (sannyasas tu) yet not engaging in the devotional service of the Lord cannot make one happy; it afflicts one with distress (duhkham aptum ayogatah).

{"question": "How do Vaisnava sannyasis differ from Mayavadi sannyasis in their engagements and outcomes, according to the purport of Gita 5.6?", "answer": "The purport explains Vaisnava sannyasis study Bhagavatam philosophy and engage in devotional service (pancaratriki regulations), performing various transcendental activities for the Lord, and are guaranteed ultimate entrance into God's kingdom. Mayavadi sannyasis study Sankhya, Vedanta (with their own Sariraka-bhasya commentary), and speculate; they cannot relish transcendental service, their studies become tedious, and they may fall down into material philanthropic activities.", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "6"}

{"question": "Why is a person in Krsna consciousness dear to every living being, and why are their senses controlled, according to the purport of Gita 5.7?", "answer": "The purport explains such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from Krsna. By working in Krsna consciousness, they serve all (like watering a tree's root benefits all leaves/branches). Everyone is satisfied by their work, so they are pure in consciousness. Because pure, their mind is controlled; because mind is controlled, senses are controlled, fixed on Krsna, not engaging elsewhere.", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "7"}
{"question": "What does a person in divine consciousness ('yuktah tattva-vit') always know within himself, even while engaged in various sensory activities, according to Bhagavad Gita 5.8-9?", "answer": "Gita 5.8-9 states: 'A person in the divine consciousness (yuktah tattva-vit), although engaged in seeing (pasyan), hearing (srnvan), touching (sprsan), smelling (jighrann), eating (asnan), moving about (gacchan), sleeping (svapan) and breathing (svasan), always knows within himself that he actually does nothing at all (naiva kincit karomiti manyeta). Because while speaking (pralapan), evacuating (visrjan), receiving (grhnann), opening (unmisan) or closing his eyes (nimisann api), he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects (indriyanindriyarthesu vartanta iti dharayan) and that he is aloof from them.'", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "9"}
{"question": "How does a Krsna conscious person differ from one in material consciousness regarding the engagement of senses, as per the purport of Gita 5.8-9?", "answer": "The purport explains a Krsna conscious person is pure and has nothing to do with work depending on the five causes because they are in Krsna's loving transcendental service. Though appearing to act with body/senses, they are conscious of their spiritual engagement. In material consciousness, senses are for sense gratification; in Krsna consciousness, senses are for satisfying Krsna's senses.

{"question": "What does 'brahmani' mean here, and how does knowing that everything belongs to Krsna affect one's relationship with activity results, according to the purport of Gita 5.10?", "answer": "The purport explains 'brahmani' means in Krsna consciousness. Everything in the material world is a manifestation of Brahman and belongs to Krsna. One who knows this perfectly (He is proprietor, everything is for His service) naturally has nothing to do with their activities' results (virtuous or sinful).

{"question": "What is the secret of Krsna consciousness that leads to peace and fearlessness, as explained in the purport of Gita 5.12?", "answer": "The purport explains the difference between a Krsna conscious person (attached to Krsna) and one in bodily consciousness (attached to activity results). The Krsna conscious person is liberated, not anxious for fruitive rewards. In Krsna consciousness, there's no duality; all is Krsna's energy, and Krsna is all good. Activities are on the absolute plane, transcendental, with no material effect.

{"question": "How can one become aloof from bodily activities and revive their real position, according to the purport of Gita 5.13, citing Svetasvatara Upanisad?", "answer": "The purport explains the embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates (body). Due to forgetfulness of superior nature, he identifies with the material body and suffers. By Krsna consciousness, he can revive his real position and come out of embodiment, becoming aloof from bodily activities. The Svetasvatara Upanisad (3.18) says the Lord within controls all.

{"question": "What is the cause of bodily suffering and distress, and what is the best solution for the living entity struggling in the material ocean, as per the purport of Gita 5.14?", "answer": "The purport explains the temporary body is the cause of varied activities and reactions. Living in this conditional atmosphere, one suffers by identifying with the body in ignorance. This ignorance, acquired since time immemorial, is the cause of bodily suffering.

The Lord is omnipotent (vibhu); the living entity is atomic (anu). The living entity desires by free will; such desire is fulfilled by the omnipotent Lord.

{"question": "How can real knowledge be obtained, and what is the role of a bona fide spiritual master in this, as per the purport of Gita 5.16?", "answer": "The purport explains that those who forget Krsna are bewildered; Krsna conscious persons are not. Perfect knowledge is achieved by surrendering to Krsna (Gita 7.19). Real knowledge can be obtained from a person in perfect Krsna consciousness.

He doesn't feel material miseries; this is brahma-nirvana (absence of material miseries due to constant immersion in the Supreme).", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "26"}
{"question": "Describe the yogic practice of sense and breath control detailed in Bhagavad Gita 5.27-28 for becoming free from desire, fear, and anger, leading to liberation.", "answer": "Gita 5.27-28 describes: 'Shutting out all external sense objects (sparsan krtva bahir bahyams), keeping the eyes and vision concentrated between the two eyebrows (caksus caivantare bhruvoh), suspending the inward and outward breaths within the nostrils (pranapanau samau krtva nasabhyantara-carinau)—thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence (yatendriya-mano-buddhir), the transcendentalist (munir) becomes free from desire, fear and anger (vigateccha-bhaya-krodho), being so destined for liberation (moksa-parayanah). One who is always in this state (yah sada) is certainly liberated (mukta eva sah).'", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "28"}
{"question": "What is 'astanga-yoga', and how does Krsna consciousness compare as a method of controlling senses, according to the purport of Gita 5.27-28?", "answer": "The purport explains the Lord gives instruction for astanga-yoga (eightfold procedure: yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, samadhi) as a way to liberation. Pratyahara involves driving out sense objects (sound, touch, form, taste, smell). This yoga process helps free one from fear/anger, feel Supersoul's presence. Krsna consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga principles. A Krsna conscious person, always in devotional service, doesn't risk senses engaging elsewhere – a better way to control senses than astanga-yoga.", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "28"}
{"question": "Knowing Krsna in what three capacities do sages attain peace from material miseries ('santim rcchati'), according to Bhagavad Gita 5.29?", "answer": "Gita 5.29 states: 'The sages, knowing Me (jnatva mam) as the ultimate purpose (beneficiary) of all sacrifices and austerities (bhoktaram yajna-tapasam), the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods (sarva-loka-mahesvaram) and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam), attain peace from the pangs of material miseries (santim rcchati).'", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "29"}
{"question": "What is the greatest peace formula, and what is the sense of Krsna consciousness, as explained in the purport of Gita 5.29?", "answer": "The purport states the greatest peace formula is: Lord Krsna is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to His transcendental service because He is proprietor of all planets and demigods; no one is greater. The sense of Krsna consciousness is: Lord Krsna is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including great demigods, are His subordinates. Perfect peace is only in complete Krsna consciousness.", "source_chapter": "5", "source_verse": "29"}
