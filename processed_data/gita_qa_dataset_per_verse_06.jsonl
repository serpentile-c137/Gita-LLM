{"question": "Why is a Krsna conscious person simultaneously a sannyasi and a yogi, as explained in the purport of Gita 6.2?", "answer": "The purport explains real sannyasa-yoga (bhakti) means knowing one's constitutional position and acting accordingly. When in Krsna consciousness, one ceases material sense gratification. A Krsna conscious person has no opportunity to engage senses in anything not for Krsna's purpose.

The beginning is 'yogaruruksu' stage (fruitive material activities like asanas for mental equilibrium and sense control).

The pure soul is entangled due to the mind's ego desiring to lord over material nature. The best way to disentangle is to always engage the mind in Krsna consciousness.

{"question": "What is the consequence of an unconquered mind, and what does real yoga practice entail, according to the purport of Gita 6.6?", "answer": "The purport explains that unless the mind is controlled, yoga practice is a waste of time. An unconquered mind makes one serve dictations of lust, anger, avarice, etc., spoiling life's mission. When conquered, one voluntarily abides by the Personality of Godhead's (Paramatma's) dictation.

{"question": "Why is book knowledge without realization of the Supreme Truth useless, and how is realized knowledge obtained, according to the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu quote in the purport of Gita 6.8?", "answer": "The purport quotes Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.234): 'No one can understand Krsna's transcendental name, form, quality, pastimes through materially contaminated senses. Only when spiritually saturated by transcendental service are these revealed.' Mundane scholarship alone cannot make one Krsna conscious. One needs association with a person in pure consciousness.

{"question": "What is Krsna consciousness described as in relation to yoga practice, and what does the understanding of Krsna as Paramatma in everyone's heart do for the yogi, according to the purport of Gita 6.31?", "answer": "The purport states Krsna consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This very understanding that Krsna is present as Paramatma in everyone's heart makes the yogi faultless. A devotee always acting in Krsna consciousness is automatically liberated (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu). Concentrating on Krsna's transcendental form, one becomes absorbed in thinking of Krsna and attains transcendental association with Him (Narada-pancaratra).", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "31"}
{"question": "Who is considered a perfect yogi ('sa yogi paramo matah') by Krsna, in terms of how they view the equality of all beings, according to Bhagavad Gita 6.32?", "answer": "Krsna states in Gita 6.32: 'He is a perfect yogi (sa yogi paramo matah) who, by comparison to his own self (atmaupamyena), sees the true equality of all beings (sarvatra samam pasyati yo 'rjuna), both in their happiness (sukham va) and distress (yadi va duhkham), O Arjuna!'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "32"}
{"question": "Why is a Krsna conscious person the best philanthropist and dearest servitor of the Lord, according to the purport of Gita 6.32?", "answer": "The purport explains a Krsna conscious person is a perfect yogi, aware of everyone's happiness/distress. Distress is from forgetting God relationship; happiness is knowing Krsna as supreme enjoyer, proprietor, friend. Because one in Krsna consciousness is happy, they try to distribute Krsna knowledge everywhere. Broadcasting importance of Krsna consciousness, they are best philanthropist, dearest servitor. They look to all living entities' welfare, factually friend of everyone, not desiring yoga perfection for personal benefit but for others.", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "32"}
{"question": "How did Arjuna perceive the system of yoga summarized by Krsna, due to the mind's nature, as stated in Bhagavad Gita 6.33?", "answer": "Arjuna said in Gita 6.33: 'O Madhusudana (madhusudana), the system of yoga (yo 'yam yogas) which You have summarized (tvaya proktah samyena) appears impractical and unendurable to me (etasyaham na pasyami), for the mind is restless and unsteady (cancalatvat sthitim sthiram).'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "33"}
{"question": "Why did Arjuna, as a practical man, find the yoga system impossible to follow, even with his favorable endowments, and what does this imply for people in the Age of Kali, according to the purport of Gita 6.33?", "answer": "The purport explains Arjuna, despite being from royal family, great warrior, long-lived, Krsna's intimate friend, found it impossible. Five thousand years ago, he had better facilities than we do now. If it was impossible for him, it's generally impossible in Kali-yuga, characterized by short life and struggle. People aren't serious about self-realization even by simple means, let alone this difficult yoga. So-called yoga schools are wasting time, ignorant of the goal.", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "33"}
{"question": "How did Arjuna describe the nature of the mind, and how did he compare the difficulty of subduing it, in Bhagavad Gita 6.34?", "answer": "Arjuna said in Gita 6.34: 'For the mind (manah) is restless (cancalam hi), turbulent (pramathi), obstinate (drdham) and very strong (balavad), O Krsna (krsna), and to subdue it (tasyaham nigraham manye), I think, is more difficult than controlling the wind (vayor iva su-duskaram).'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "34"}
{"question": "What is the easiest way to control the mind, as suggested by Lord Caitanya and prescribed in scriptures, according to the purport of Gita 6.34?", "answer": "The purport explains the mind is strong, often overcoming intelligence. It's harder to control than wind. The easiest way, suggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting 'Hare Krsna' (great mantra for deliverance) in all humility. The prescribed method is 'sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh': engage one's mind fully in Krsna. Only then will no other engagements agitate the mind.", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "34"}
{"question": "What did Sri Bhagavan acknowledge about curbing the restless mind, and by what means did He say it is possible, in Bhagavad Gita 6.35?", "answer": "The Blessed Lord said in Gita 6.35: 'O mighty-armed son of Kunti (maha-baho), it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind (mano durnigraham calam asamsayam), but it is possible by constant practice (abhyasena tu kaunteya) and by detachment (vairagyena ca grhyate).'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "35"}
{"question": "What is the practice suggested for controlling the mind in the present age, and what is 'vairagya', according to the purport of Gita 6.35?", "answer": "The purport states strict yoga rules are hard now. By Krsna consciousness, one engages in nine types of devotional service. First is hearing about Krsna, a powerful method to purge mind of misgivings. More one hears, more enlightened and detached one becomes from things drawing mind from Krsna. 'Vairagya' means detachment from matter and engagement of mind in spirit. Attaching mind to Krsna's activities is easier than impersonal detachment. Hearing Krsna gives spiritual satisfaction (paresanubhava), like a hungry man eating.", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "35"}
{"question": "For whom is self-realization ('yogah') difficult work ('dusprapah'), and for whom is it practical to achieve by right means ('sakyo 'vaptum upayatah'), according to Krsna's opinion in Bhagavad Gita 6.36?", "answer": "Krsna stated in Gita 6.36: 'For one whose mind is unbridled (asamyatatmana), self-realization (yogah) is difficult work (dusprapa iti me matih).

That is My opinion.'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "36"}
{"question": "Why is trying to practice yoga while engaging the mind in material enjoyment like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it, as per the purport of Gita 6.36?", "answer": "The purport explains one not accepting proper treatment to detach mind from material engagement can hardly achieve self-realization. Yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time, possibly materially lucrative but useless spiritually. Mind must be controlled by constant engagement in Lord's transcendental loving service. Unless in Krsna consciousness, one cannot steadily control mind.

{"question": "What is 'yogac calita-manasah', and why might a sincere aspirant deviate from the transcendental path, according to the purport of Gita 6.37?", "answer": "The purport explains 'yogac calita-manasah' is deviation from the transcendental path. The path of self-realization is like declaring war on illusory energy. Whenever one tries to escape illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by material energy modes, and there's every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines.", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "37"}
{"question": "What does Arjuna fear might happen to a man deviated from the path of transcendence ('brahmanah pathi'), comparing him to a 'riven cloud' ('chinnabhram iva nasyati'), in Bhagavad Gita 6.38?", "answer": "Arjuna asked: 'O mighty-armed Krsna (maha-baho), does not such a man (kaccin), being deviated from the path of transcendence (vimudho brahmanah pathi), perish like a riven cloud (chinnabhram iva nasyati), with no position in any sphere (nobhaya-vibhrastas apratisthah)?'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "38"}
{"question": "What are the two ways to progress, and why might a failed aspiring transcendentalist lose both materially and spiritually, according to the purport of Gita 6.38?", "answer": "The purport outlines two paths: Materialists seek material advancement/higher planets. Transcendentalists cease material activities, sacrifice material happiness. If an aspiring transcendentalist fails, they apparently lose both: can't enjoy material happiness nor spiritual success. They have no position, like a riven cloud that deviates from a small cloud, fails to join a big one, and is blown away, becoming a nonentity. The supermost path is bhakti-yoga (Krsna consciousness).", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "38"}

{"question": "Why is Krsna's verdict considered final and complete for all doubts, as per the purport of Gita 6.39?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna is the perfect knower of past, present, and future. No one, including great sages/philosophers at material nature's mercy, equals Him. Therefore, Krsna's verdict is final and complete because He knows everything perfectly, but no one knows Him. Krsna and Krsna conscious devotees alone can know what is what.", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "39"}
{"question": "What did Sri Bhagavan assure Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita 6.40 about the fate of a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities ('kalyana-krt')?", "answer": "The Blessed Lord said: 'Son of Prtha (partha), a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities (kalyana-krt) does not meet with destruction (vinasas tasya vidyate na eva) either in this world (iha) or in the spiritual world (namutra); one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil (na hi kascid durgatim tata gacchati).'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "40"}
{"question": "What does Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.17) state about one who takes complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead versus a nondevotee, as quoted in the purport of Gita 6.40?", "answer": "The purport quotes Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.17) where Narada Muni tells Vyasadeva: 'If someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way. On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything.'

{"question": "After many years of enjoyment on planets of the pious, where is the unsuccessful yogi ('yoga-bhrasto') born, according to Bhagavad Gita 6.41?", "answer": "Gita 6.41 states: 'The unsuccessful yogi (yoga-bhrasto), after many, many years of enjoyment (usitva sasvatih samah) on the planets of the pious living entities (prapya punya-krtam lokan), is born into a family of righteous people (sucinam gehe), or into a family of rich aristocracy (srimatam abhijayate).'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "41"}
{"question": "What are the two classes of unsuccessful yogis, and what opportunities are they given by the Lord's grace, as per the purport of Gita 6.41?", "answer": "The purport divides unsuccessful yogis: one fallen after little progress, one after long practice. The one with short practice goes to higher planets of pious entities, lives long, then is reborn on this planet in a righteous brahmana vaisnava or aristocratic merchant family. They are allowed full utilization of material propensities, then given opportunities to live prosperously and try to elevate to full Krsna consciousness.", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "41"}
{"question": "Alternatively, where might an unsuccessful yogi take birth, which is considered very rare ('durlabhataram'), as stated in Bhagavad Gita 6.42?", "answer": "Gita 6.42 states: 'Or (atha va) he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists (yoginam eva kule bhavati) who are surely great in wisdom (dhimatam). Verily, such a birth (etad dhi janma yad idrsam) is rare in this world (durlabhataram loke).'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "42"}
{"question": "Why is birth in a family of yogis or transcendentalists praised, and what example is given regarding spiritual masters, in the purport of Gita 6.42?", "answer": "The purport praises this birth because the child receives spiritual impetus from life's beginning, especially in acarya or gosvami families, who are learned and devoted by tradition and training, becoming spiritual masters. Examples: Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja and the author (A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada) took birth in such families, trained in devotional service from the beginning.", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "42"}
{"question": "Upon taking such a birth (in a family of yogis), what does the unsuccessful yogi revive, and what does he try to do further, according to Bhagavad Gita 6.43?", "answer": "Gita 6.43 states: 'On taking such a birth (tatra tam), he again revives the divine consciousness of his previous life (buddhi-samyogam labhate paurva-dehikam), and he tries to make further progress (yatate ca tato bhuyah) in order to achieve complete success (samsiddhau kuru-nandana), O son of Kuru.'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "43"}
{"question": "Who is given as an example of good birth for revival of previous transcendental consciousness, and what does his life illustrate, as per the purport of Gita 6.43?", "answer": "The purport gives King Bharata as an example. He took his third birth in a good brahmana family. He was emperor of the world (planet then known as Bharata-varsa). Retired early for spiritual perfection but failed. Next life born as Jada Bharata (secluded, non-talkative), later discovered as greatest transcendentalist. His life shows transcendental endeavors (yoga practice) never go in vain.

Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far, far advanced in spiritual life, even if born in families of dog-eaters.

{"question": "When the yogi engages with sincere endeavor, being washed of all contaminations, what does he ultimately attain after many births of practice, according to Bhagavad Gita 6.45?", "answer": "Gita 6.45 states: 'But when the yogi (yogi) engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress (prayatnad yatamanas tu), being washed of all contaminations (samsuddha-kilbisah), then ultimately, after many, many births of practice (aneka-janma-samsiddhas), he attains the supreme goal (tato yati param gatim).'", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "45"}

With determination, they begin the unfinished task, cleansing all material contaminations. When finally free, they attain supreme perfection—Krsna consciousness. Krsna consciousness is the perfect stage of being freed of all contaminations. Confirmed by Gita 7.28: 'yesam tv anta-gatam papam jananam punya-karmanam te dvandva-moha-nirmukta bhajante mam drdha-vratah' (After many pious births, freed from contaminations and illusory dualities, one engages in Lord's transcendental loving service).", "source_chapter": "6", "source_verse": "45"}

{"question": "What is the most highly praised form of yoga performance mentioned here, and how does it relate to other forms like asceticism and empiric knowledge, as per the purport of Gita 6.46?", "answer": "The purport explains yoga means linking consciousness with Supreme Absolute Truth. Different methods: karma-yoga (fruitive), jnana-yoga (empirical), bhakti-yoga (devotional relationship). Bhakti-yoga (Krsna consciousness) is ultimate perfection of all yogas. Lord confirms yoga's superiority but not over bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga is full spiritual knowledge, excelling all.

'Worship' (adore, show respect) is not the same. Service with love and faith is for Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man/demigod (discourteous), but cannot avoid serving Supreme Lord without condemnation. Every living entity constitutionally serves Supreme; failing this, they fall. Bhagavatam (11.5.3) confirms this using 'bhajanti'.
