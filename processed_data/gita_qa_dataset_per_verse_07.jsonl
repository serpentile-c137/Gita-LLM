{"question": "What does Sri Bhagavan instruct Arjuna to hear in Bhagavad Gita 7.1, regarding practicing yoga in full consciousness of Him?", "answer": "The Supreme Lord said: 'Now hear (tac chrnu), O son of Prtha [Arjuna] (partha), how by practicing yoga (yogam yunjan) in full consciousness of Me (mad-asrayah), with mind attached to Me (mayy asakta-manah), you can know Me in full (samagram mam), free from doubt (asamsayam yatha jnasyasi).'", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "1"}
{"question": "What is described as the highest form of all yoga at the end of the Sixth Chapter, and what can one know by concentrating their mind on Krsna, according to the purport of Gita 7.1?", "answer": "The purport states that at the end of the Sixth Chapter, steady concentration of the mind upon Krsna (Krsna consciousness) is clearly stated as the highest form of all yoga. By concentrating one's mind upon Krsna, one can know the Absolute Truth completely. Impersonal brahmajyoti or localized Paramatma realization is not perfect knowledge because it is partial.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "1"}
{"question": "What knowledge, both phenomenal and noumenal, will Krsna declare in full to Arjuna, knowing which nothing further remains to be known, as stated in Bhagavad Gita 7.2?", "answer": "Gita 7.2 states: 'I shall now declare unto you in full (idam vaksyamy asesatah) this knowledge both phenomenal (jnanam te 'ham) and noumenal (sa-vijnanam), by knowing which (yaj jnatva) there shall remain nothing further to be known (neha bhuyo 'nyaj jnatavyam avasisyate).'", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "2"}
{"question": "How can complete knowledge be achieved, and who is the only object for meditation in all types of yoga practice, according to the purport of Gita 7.2?", "answer": "The purport explains complete knowledge includes knowledge of the phenomenal world and the spirit behind it, with the source of both being transcendental knowledge. This complete knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord directly from the Lord in disciplic succession. One should know the source of all knowledge, Krsna, who is the cause of all causes and the only object for meditation.

{"question": "Why is it very difficult for nondevotees to know Krsna, even if they have transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman, according to the purport of Gita 7.3?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna is the Supreme Person, beyond Brahman and Paramatma knowledge. Yogis and jnanis are confused. Even Sankaracarya admitted Krsna is Supreme, but his followers don't accept it. Although nondevotees claim bhakti is easy, they can't practice it properly. Real bhakti, according to rules, makes speculative scholars fall away. They cannot understand Krsna as Yasoda's son or Arjuna's charioteer. Only pure devotees, by Krsna's benevolence, can know His inconceivable qualities.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "3"}
{"question": "What are the eight constituents of Krsna's separated material energies ('bhinna prakrtir astadha'), as listed in Bhagavad Gita 7.4?", "answer": "Gita 7.4 lists them as: 'Earth (bhumir), water (apo), fire (analo), air (vayuh), ether (kham), mind (mano), intelligence (buddhir eva ca) and false ego (ahankara itiyam me).'", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "4"}
{"question": "What are the three Visnu expansions for material creation, and what are their functions, according to the Satvata-tantra quoted in the purport of Gita 7.4?", "answer": "The purport quotes Satvata-tantra: 1) Maha-Visnu creates the total material energy (mahat-tattva). 2) Garbhodakasayi Visnu enters all universes to create diversities. 3) Ksirodakasayi Visnu is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul (Paramatma) in all universes, present even in atoms. Knowing these three Visnus liberates one from material entanglement.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "4"}
{"question": "Besides Krsna's inferior material nature, what is His superior energy ('prakrtim viddhi me param'), and what is its role in the universe, according to Bhagavad Gita 7.5?", "answer": "Gita 7.5 states: 'Besides this inferior nature (apareyam itas tu), O mighty-armed Arjuna (maha-baho), there is a superior energy of Mine (anyam prakrtim viddhi me param), which comprises all the living entities (jiva-bhutam) who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe (yayedam dharyate jagat).'", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "5"}
{"question": "What is the distinction between living entities and the Lord, as described in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.87.30) quoted in the purport of Gita 7.5?", "answer": "The purport quotes Bhagavatam (10.87.30): If embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like God, they wouldn't be under His control. If accepted as minute energies, they are subject to His supreme control. Real liberation is surrendering to His control, making them happy. Men with limited knowledge advocating God and living entities are equal mislead themselves and others.

{"question": "How is the material body developed, and similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation, according to the purport of Gita 7.6?", "answer": "The purport explains spirit is the basic field of creation; matter is created by spirit. The material body develops because spirit is present within matter; a child grows due to the superior energy (spirit soul) being present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe develops because of the presence of the Supersoul, Visnu. Spirit and matter are originally two energies of the Lord, so He is the original cause.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "6"}
{"question": "What is stated about any truth superior to Krsna, and how does everything rest upon Him, in Bhagavad Gita 7.7?", "answer": "Gita 7.7 states: 'O conqueror of wealth [Arjuna] (dhananjaya), there is no truth superior to Me (mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti).

Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that Supreme Person. There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person because He is the supermost. He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest.

{"question": "What is Lord Caitanya's sublime doctrine mentioned in the purport of Gita 7.8, regarding the personal and impersonal conceptions of God?", "answer": "The purport states that one who knows God knows that impersonal and personal conceptions are simultaneously present in everything without contradiction. Therefore, Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: 'acintya bheda-and-abheda-tattva'â€”simultaneously one and different.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "8"}
{"question": "In Bhagavad Gita 7.9, how does Krsna describe His presence in earth, fire, all living beings, and ascetics?", "answer": "Krsna states in Gita 7.9: 'I am the original fragrance of the earth (punyo gandhah prthivyam ca), and I am the heat in fire (tejas casmi vibhavasau).

Everything in the material world has an uncontaminated, original flavor/fragrance, which is Krsna. In Krsna consciousness, we become aware that earth, water, fire, air, every active principle, all chemicals and material elements are due to Krsna. Man's life duration is also due to Krsna; by His grace, man can prolong or diminish it. Krsna consciousness is active in every sphere.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "9"}

{"question": "How does Krsna, as the original root, maintain everything in the material manifestation, according to the purport of Gita 7.10?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna is the seed (bijam) of everything. Brahman (Supreme Absolute Truth) is that from which everything emanates. Krsna is Parabrahman, the Supreme Spirit. Krsna is the source of everything, the root. As a tree's root maintains the whole tree, Krsna, being the original root of all things, maintains everything in this material manifestation.

{"question": "How should a strong man's strength be applied, and what is the purpose of sex life according to religious principles, as per the purport of Gita 7.11?", "answer": "The purport states a strong man's strength should be applied to protect the weak, not for personal aggression. Similarly, sex life, according to religious principles (dharma), should be for the propagation of children, not otherwise.

{"question": "What does Krsna state about His relationship with all states of being (goodness, passion, ignorance) in Bhagavad Gita 7.12?", "answer": "Krsna states in Gita 7.12: 'All states of being (bhava)â€”be they of goodness (sattvika), passion (rajasas) or ignorance (tamasas ca ye)â€”are manifested by My energy (matta eveti tan viddhi).

{"question": "Why is Krsna called 'nirguna', and how does this relate to His being subject to material modes, according to the purport of Gita 7.12?", "answer": "The purport explains all material activities are under the three material modes, which emanate from Krsna. However, Krsna is not subject to them, like a king (lawmaker) is not subject to state laws. Therefore, He is 'nirguna', meaning these gunas (modes), though issuing from Him, do not affect Him.

{"question": "How do people get entangled with material nature's modes and forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead, according to the purport of Gita 7.13?", "answer": "The purport explains everyone in the material world is under the influence of the three gunas and thus bewildered. By nature, living entities have particular body types and psychic/biological activities. Due to the spell of illusory energy, we consider ourselves by this bodily conception (American, Indian, brahmana, Hindu, etc.). Entangled with material modes, we forget the Supreme Godhead behind them. Krsna consciousness is transcendental to these modes; those established in it are liberated.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "13"}

{"question": "Why is the conditioned soul called 'nitya-baddha', and who can release them from material nature's bondage, as per the purport of Gita 7.14?", "answer": "The purport explains living entities belong to Lord's eternal superior nature, but due to contamination by inferior nature (matter), their illusion is also eternal. Thus, the conditioned soul is 'nitya-baddha' (eternally conditioned). Material energy is ultimately conducted by supreme will, which living entity cannot overcome. A bound person cannot free himself; rescuer must be liberated. Only Lord Krsna or His bona fide representative (spiritual master) can release conditioned soul.

{"question": "Describe the 'mudhas' (grossly foolish) as one of the four types of miscreants, using the ass analogy from the purport of Gita 7.15.", "answer": "The purport describes 'mudhas' as grossly foolish, like hard-working beasts of burden. They want to enjoy their labor's fruits themselves, not for the Supreme. Example: the ass, working hard for its master, satisfied by grass, sleep, and sex, unaware for whom it truly works. It doesn't know karma is for yajna. Such mudhas say they have no time for spiritual matters, valuing destructible material gains, wasting time serving mammon, never surrendering to the supreme master.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "15"}
{"question": "Who are the four kinds of pious men ('sukrtino') who render devotional service unto Krsna, according to Bhagavad Gita 7.16?", "answer": "Gita 7.16 lists them: 'O best among the Bharatas [Arjuna] (arjuna), four kinds of pious men (catur-vidha janah sukrtino) render devotional service unto Me (bhajante mam)â€”the distressed (artah), the desirer of wealth (artharthi), the inquisitive (jijnasur), and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute (jnani ca bharatarsabha).'", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "16"}
{"question": "Are these four types of men pure devotees, and when can they become pure devotees, according to the purport of Gita 7.16?", "answer": "The purport states these are not pure devotees because they have aspirations to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration or material profit desire (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11). When these four types come to the Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by associating with a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As long as not purified, their service is tainted with fruitive activities/mundane knowledge search.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "16"}
{"question": "Of the four kinds of pious men who serve Krsna, who is considered the best ('visisyate'), and why, according to Bhagavad Gita 7.17?", "answer": "Gita 7.17 states: 'Of these (tesam), the wise one (jnani) who is in full knowledge in union with Me through pure devotional service (nitya-yukta eka-bhaktir) is the best (visisyate).

{"question": "How does one realize their constitutional position as God's eternal servant, and what is the Lord's view of a devotee in full knowledge engaged in devotional service, as per the purport of Gita 7.17?", "answer": "The purport explains that by searching for knowledge, one realizes self is different from material body, then advances to impersonal Brahman and Paramatma knowledge. When fully purified, one realizes their constitutional position as God's eternal servant. Through pure devotee association, all four types become pure.

The devotee does not know anything beyond Me, and I also cannot forget the devotee. There is a very intimate relationship between Me and the pure devotees.

{"question": "What does one understand when further advanced in spiritual realization, beyond impersonalism, and what does such a universal vision of Vasudeva precipitate, as per the purport of Gita 7.19?", "answer": "The purport explains that in beginning of spiritual realization, while giving up materialism, there's leaning to impersonalism. Further advanced, one understands spiritual life has activities: devotional service. Realizing this, one attaches to Supreme Personality and surrenders. Then one understands Krsna's mercy is everything, He's cause of all causes, material manifestation isn't independent. Realizing everything relates to Krsna (Vasudeva), this universal vision precipitates full surrender to Lord Krsna as highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are rare.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "19"}
{"question": "To whom do those whose minds are distorted by material desires ('kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah') surrender, and what rules do they follow, according to Bhagavad Gita 7.20?", "answer": "Gita 7.20 states: 'Those whose minds are distorted by material desires (kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah) surrender unto demigods (prapadyante 'nya-devatah) and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship (tam tam niyamam asthaya) according to their own natures (prakrtya niyatah svaya).'", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "20"}
{"question": "Why do less intelligent people generally not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for immediate fulfillment of material desires, and what does a pure devotee do, according to the purport of Gita 7.20?", "answer": "The purport explains less intelligent people with lost spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate material desires. They usually don't go to Supreme Lord because they are in particular modes (ignorance/passion), so worship various demigods, satisfied by following rules. They are motivated by small desires, not knowing how to reach supreme goal. A pure devotee knows Krsna is master of all (Caitanya-caritamrta: ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya) and never goes to demigods for material needs, depending on Supreme Lord, satisfied with whatever He gives.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "20"}

{"question": "Why does the all-powerful God give facilities to living entities for material enjoyment, letting them fall into illusory energy's trap, as per the purport of Gita 7.21?", "answer": "The purport explains God gives everyone independence. If Supreme Lord as Supersoul doesn't give facilities for material desires, then independence has no meaning. He gives full independence for whatever one likes, but His ultimate instruction is to surrender fully to Him, which makes man happy. Both living entity and demigods are subordinate to Supreme's will.

{"question": "Why does a living entity usually go to demigods, and what is contradictory about one who worships the Supreme Lord while desiring material enjoyment, as per the purport of Gita 7.22?", "answer": "The purport explains a living entity usually goes to demigods because he is mad to fulfill his lust, when something undue is desired and the Lord Himself doesn't fulfill it. Caitanya-caritamrta says one worshiping Supreme Lord and simultaneously desiring material enjoyment is contradictory. Demigod worship is material; Supreme Lord's devotional service is spiritual. For one desiring to return to Godhead, material desires are impediments.

{"question": "Why are worshippers of demigods less intelligent, even if demigods are parts of the Supreme Lord, as per the purport of Gita 7.23?", "answer": "The purport explains worshipers of demigods are less intelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food must be supplied (like trying to feed body via ears/eyes). They don't know demigods are parts of Supreme Lord's universal body and ignorantly believe each demigod is a separate, competing God. Results of demigod worship are perishable as demigods, their planets, and worshipers are perishable.

When fully in Krsna consciousness (beginning by chanting Hare Krsna maha-mantra), one can understand Supreme.

{"question": "What is the 'yoga-maya' curtain, and what does the devotee pray for regarding it in the Isopanisad, as cited in the purport of Gita 7.25?", "answer": "The purport explains the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-maya, so ordinary people cannot understand Him.

{"question": "How is Krsna's body unlike an ordinary human's regarding remembrance and change, and what is stated about maya covering Him, as per the purport of Gita 7.26?", "answer": "The purport explains if Krsna were material (maya), He'd change body and forget past, like ordinary humans. But Krsna clearly says He knows past, present, future (e.g., instructing Vivasvan millions of years ago). His transcendental body isn't perishable. He's like sun; maya is like cloud. Clouds only apparently cover sun for our limited vision; sun isn't actually covered. Similarly, maya cannot cover Supreme Lord. By His internal potency, He's not manifest to less intelligent.", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "26"}
{"question": "By what are all living entities born into delusion ('sammoham sarge yanti'), according to Bhagavad Gita 7.27?", "answer": "Gita 7.27 states: 'O scion of Bharata [Arjuna] (bharata), O conqueror of the foe (parantapa), all living entities (sarva-bhutani) are born into delusion (sammoham sarge yanti), overcome by the dualities of desire and hate (iccha-dvesa-samutthena dvandva-mohena).'", "source_chapter": "7", "source_verse": "27"}
{"question": "What is the real constitutional position of the living entity, and how does illusory energy manifest, leading to delusion, as per the purport of Gita 7.27?", "answer": "The purport explains the living entity's real constitutional position is subordination to Supreme Lord (pure knowledge). Deluded into separation from this, one is controlled by illusory energy, cannot understand Supreme. Illusory energy manifests in duality of desire and hate. Due to desire/hate, ignorant person wants to become one with Supreme, envies Krsna as Supreme. Pure devotees, not so deluded, understand Krsna appears by internal potencies.

Only those who lived by religious regulative principles, acted piously, conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service, gradually rise to pure knowledge of Supreme. Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) says if one wants liberation, they must serve devotees (mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh).

{"question": "What is the Brahman conception of life in devotional service, and who are actually entitled to be called Brahman, according to the purport of Gita 7.29?", "answer": "The purport explains birth, death, old age, disease affect material body, not spiritual. One attaining spiritual body, becoming Lord's associate in eternal devotional service, is liberated. 'Aham brahmasmi' (I am spirit) is this Brahman conception.
