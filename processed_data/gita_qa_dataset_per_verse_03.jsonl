{"question": "What is the relationship between sankhya-yoga and karma-yoga (buddhi-yoga), and which path is considered better by the purport of Gita 3.3, and why?", "answer": "The purport explains both yogas are interdependent, like religion and philosophy. The ultimate goal is Krsna. The indirect process is philosophical speculation (sankhya-yoga), while the direct process is connecting with Krsna consciousness (karma-yoga/buddhi-yoga). The path of Krsna consciousness is better because it doesn't depend on purifying senses by a philosophical process; Krsna consciousness itself is the purifying process, simultaneously easy and sublime.", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "3"}
{"question": "Can one achieve freedom from reaction ('naiskarmyam') or attain perfection ('siddhim') merely by abstaining from work or by renunciation alone, according to Bhagavad Gita 3.4?", "answer": "Gita 3.4 states: 'Not by merely abstaining from work (na karmanam anarambhan) can one achieve freedom from reaction (naiskarmyam puruso 'snute), nor by renunciation alone (na ca sannyasanad eva) can one attain perfection (siddhim samadhigacchati).'", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "4"}

{"question": "What is the nature of the soul, and what happens if it's not engaged in Krsna consciousness, as per the purport of Gita 3.5?", "answer": "The purport explains it is the nature of the soul to be always active. The spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Krsna consciousness; otherwise, it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy.

{"question": "Why is the knowledge of a pretender who speaks on dry philosophy considered valueless, according to the purport of Gita 3.6?", "answer": "The purport explains that such pretenders, who make a show of meditation while dwelling on sense enjoyment, are the greatest cheaters.

Others who prepare food for self-gratification are not only thieves but also eaters of all kinds of sins, and thus cannot be happy.", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "13"}
{"question": "What is the cycle of sustenance starting from food grains, involving rains and yajna, as described in Bhagavad Gita 3.14?", "answer": "Gita 3.14 states: 'All living bodies (bhutani) subsist on food grains (annad bhavanti), which are produced from rains (parjanyad anna-sambhavah).

{"question": "How does action in Krsna consciousness differ from Vedic rituals like prescribed sacrifices, as explained in the purport of Gita 3.19?", "answer": "The purport explains Vedic rituals are performed for purification of impious activities from sense gratification.

{"question": "How do devotees of the Lord differ from what Krsna advises regarding not disturbing ignorant men, as explained in the purport of Gita 3.29?", "answer": "The purport states Krsna advises not to disturb ignorant men and waste time. However, devotees are more kind than the Lord because they understand His purpose. Consequently, they undertake all risks, even approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in Krsna consciousness, which is absolutely necessary for human beings.", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "29"}

{"question": "What do 'nirasih' and 'nirmama' mean in the context of acting in Krsna consciousness, as per the purport of Gita 3.30?", "answer": "The purport explains 'nirasih' means one has to act on the order of the master and should not expect fruitive results (like a cashier counting money for an employer but not claiming it). 'Nirmama' ('nothing is mine') means realizing that nothing in the world belongs to any individual but to the Supreme Lord. When one acts in Krsna consciousness ('mayi' - unto Me), one doesn't claim proprietorship.", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "30"}
{"question": "What is the fate of those who execute their duties according to Krsna's injunctions faithfully and without envy ('sraddhavanto 'nasuyanto'), as stated in Bhagavad Gita 3.31?", "answer": "Gita 3.31 states: 'One who execute his duties according to My injunctions (ye me matam idam nityam anutisthanti manavah) and who follows this teaching faithfully, without envy (sraddhavanto 'nasuyanto), becomes free from the bondage of fruitive actions (mucyante te 'pi karmabhih).'", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "31"}

{"question": "What is the outcome for those who, out of envy, disregard Krsna's teachings and do not practice them regularly, according to Bhagavad Gita 3.32?", "answer": "Gita 3.32 states: 'But those who, out of envy (ye tv etad abhyasuyanto) disregard these teachings and do not practice them regularly (nanutisthanti me matam), are to be considered bereft of all knowledge (sarva-jnana-vimudhams tan), befooled, and doomed to ignorance and bondage (viddhi nastan acetasah).'", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "32"}
{"question": "Why is there no hope of perfection for a disobedient person, however great they may be, as per the purport of Gita 3.32?", "answer": "The purport explains that a disobedient person, however great, is ignorant of their own self, the Supreme Brahman, Paramatma, and the Personality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart. Therefore, there is no hope of perfection of life for them, as there is punishment for disobedience to the Supreme's order.", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "32"}
{"question": "According to Bhagavad Gita 3.33, how does even a man of knowledge ('jnanavan api') act, and what can repression ('nigrahah') accomplish?", "answer": "Gita 3.33 states: 'Even a man of knowledge (jnanavan api) acts according to his own nature (sadrsam cestate svasyah prakrteh), for everyone follows his nature (prakrtim yanti bhutani).

Krsna consciousness helps one to get out of material entanglement, even while engaged in prescribed duties. It is better to be situated in one's position and try to attain Krsna consciousness under superior training, rather than suddenly giving up duties and becoming a so-called yogi artificially.", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "33"}
{"question": "What exists for sense objects ('indriyasyarthe'), and why should one not fall under their control, as stated in Bhagavad Gita 3.34?", "answer": "Gita 3.34 states: 'Attraction and repulsion (raga-dvesau) for sense objects (indriyasyarthe) are felt by embodied beings (vyavasthitau), but one should not fall under the control (tayor na vasam agacchet) of senses and sense objects because they are stumbling blocks (tau hy asya paripanthinau) on the path of self-realization.'", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "34"}
{"question": "What is the whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment, according to the purport of Gita 3.34?", "answer": "The purport states: 'The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of Krsna consciousness.'

But when in contact with material nature, they act sinfully, sometimes against their will. They are forced to act by a cause explained in the next verse, not by the Supersoul.", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "36"}

{"question": "How can lust and wrath become our friends instead of enemies, and what example is given in the purport of Gita 3.37?", "answer": "The purport explains if lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or desiring everything for Krsna (Krsna consciousness), then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized and become friends.

{"question": "How does lusty intelligence influence the spirit soul, as explained in the purport of Gita 3.40?", "answer": "The purport explains the mind is the reservoir of ideas for sense gratification, becoming a repository of lust with the senses.

Desire for overlording and sense gratification are the greatest enemies. By the strength of Krsna consciousness, one can control material senses, mind, and intelligence by gradually developing it and being situated in a transcendental position by steady intelligence directed toward one's pure identity.", "source_chapter": "3", "source_verse": "43"}
