{"question": "Why is the Ninth Chapter called 'the most confidential', and what does it deal with, according to the purport of Gita 9.1?", "answer": "The purport explains that topics in Chapters Seven and Eight relate to devotional service and bring enlightenment in Krsna consciousness, hence 'more confidential'. The Ninth Chapter deals with unalloyed, pure devotion, and is therefore called 'the most confidential'. One situated in this knowledge is naturally transcendental and has no material pangs.", "source_chapter": "9", "source_verse": "1"}
{"question": "How is the knowledge in Bhagavad Gita Chapter Nine described in terms of its status, secrecy, purity, perception, and performance, according to verse 9.2?", "answer": "Gita 9.2 describes this knowledge as: 'the king of education (raja-vidya), the most secret of all secrets (raja-guhyam). It is the purest knowledge (pavitram idam uttamam), and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization (pratyaksavagamam), it is the perfection of religion (dharmyam). It is everlasting (avyayam), and it is joyfully performed (su-sukham kartum).'", "source_chapter": "9", "source_verse": "2"}
{"question": "Why is the soul considered the most important part of the body, and yet what do people often neglect, according to the purport of Gita 9.2?", "answer": "The purport states the soul is the most important part of the body; without its presence, the body has no value. Yet people often place great stress on bodily necessities, not caring for the vital soul. Bhagavad-gita, from Chapter Two onwards, stresses the soul's importance, its indestructibility, and difference from the perishable body. Understanding this is a confidential part of knowledge.", "source_chapter": "9", "source_verse": "2"}
{"question": "What happens to those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service ('asraddadhanah purusa dharmasyasya'), according to Bhagavad Gita 9.3?", "answer": "Gita 9.3 states: 'Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service (asraddadhanah purusa dharmasyasya parantapa) cannot attain Me (aprapya mam), O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world (nivartante mrtyu-samsara-vartmani).'", "source_chapter": "9", "source_verse": "3"}
{"question": "What is real faith according to Caitanya-caritamrta, and what are the three classes of Krsna conscious men based on faith, as described in the purport of Gita 9.3?", "answer": "The purport quotes Caitanya-caritamrta: Real faith is complete conviction that simply by serving Krsna one achieves all perfection. Three classes: First-class: well-versed in devotional scriptures, firm faith. Second-class: not very advanced in scriptures but automatically have firm faith that krsna-bhakti is best. Third-class: neither perfect scriptural knowledge nor good faith but by association/simplicity try to follow; may fall down.

{"question": "How is the Lord perceived by His different energies, and how is this similar to perceiving the sun-god, according to the purport of Gita 9.4?", "answer": "The purport explains the Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His diverse material and spiritual energies, thus realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun (a person) is perceived by his all-pervading energy (sunshine), similarly the Lord, though in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading, diffusive energies. Everything is resting in His energy.", "source_chapter": "9", "source_verse": "4"}

{"question": "How does Krsna maintain and sustain the entire material manifestation without touching it, as explained by 'yogam aisvaram' in the purport of Gita 9.5?", "answer": "The purport explains that though everything rests on Him, Krsna is aloof. Planetary systems float in space (His energy), but He is different from space. 'Yogam aisvaram' refers to His inconceivable mystic power. Simply by His supreme will, everything is created, sustained, maintained, and annihilated. There's no difference between His mind and Himself (absolute spirit).

Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad (3.8.9) - 'By the supreme order... the moon, the sun, and other great planets are moving.' Brahma-samhita (5.52) - Sun has immense power but moves in its prescribed orbit by Govinda's order and supreme will.

{"question": "What does 'at the end of the millennium' mean in terms of Brahma's life, and what happens to the energy manifested by the Supreme Lord at that time, as per the purport of Gita 9.7?", "answer": "The purport explains 'at the end of the millennium' means at Brahma's death. Brahma lives 100 years (his day = 4,300,000,000 earth years, night same). At his death, devastation occurs; energy manifested by Supreme Lord is wound up in Himself.

{"question": "How are living entities impregnated into material nature, and how do they take different positions, according to the purport of Gita 9.8?", "answer": "The purport explains matter is manifestation of Lord's inferior energy. At creation, material energy is let loose as mahat-tattva, into which Lord as Maha-Visnu enters. He lies in Causal Ocean, breathes out universes. Lord enters each as Garbhodakasayi Visnu, then as Ksirodakasayi Visnu into everything, even atoms. Living entities are impregnated into material nature; by past deeds, they take different positions.

He's neutral like a high court judge: by his order things happen (hanging, jailing, awarding wealth), but he's neutral, unconcerned with gain/loss. Similarly, Lord is neutral, though His hand is in every sphere. He's transcendental to material dualities, not attached to creation/annihilation.

{"question": "Is the Lord directly attached to material creation, and what example from smrti illustrates His connection to it, as per the purport of Gita 9.10?", "answer": "The purport states the Lord is not directly attached to material creation. He simply glances over material nature; it's activated, everything created immediately. Example from smrti: a fragrant flower before someone; fragrance touched by smelling power, yet smelling and flower are detached. Similar connection between material world and Supreme; He has nothing to do with it but creates by His glance and ordains. Material nature, without His superintendence, cannot do anything.

{"question": "Who derides Krsna when He descends in human form ('manusim tanum asritam'), and what do they not know about Him, according to Bhagavad Gita 9.11?", "answer": "Gita 9.11 states: 'Fools (mudha) deride Me (avajananti mam) when I descend in the human form (manusim tanum asritam).

{"question": "Why is Krsna's body called 'manusim' here, and what is its actual nature, as confirmed by Vedic language, according to the purport of Gita 9.11?", "answer": "The purport explains Krsna is supreme controller (isvarah paramah krsnah), His body sac-cid-ananda (nonmaterial). Fools deride Him as man because He acts like one (Arjuna's friend, politician). His body is 'manusim' because He acts like man, but actually it's sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (eternal bliss, knowledge absolute). Confirmed in Vedic language: 'Sac-cid-ananda-rupaya krsnaya' (Gopala-tapani Upanisad 1.1), 'Tam ekam govindam...

{"question": "What false conclusion do miscreants who mock Krsna come to, and why will their attempt to become one with Krsna be baffled, according to the purport of Gita 9.12?", "answer": "The purport explains many assuming Krsna consciousness don't accept Krsna as Absolute Truth; for them, going back to Godhead won't be tasted. Those in fruitive activities hoping for liberation also fail if they deride Krsna. Mockers are demonic/atheistic, never surrender. Mental speculations lead to false conclusion: ordinary living entity and Krsna are one and same. They think human body is covered by material nature; once liberated, no difference between God and self. This attempt to become one with Krsna is baffled by delusion.

{"question": "How does one become free from material nature's control and attain the stage of 'mahatma', according to the purport of Gita 9.13?", "answer": "The purport explains the first sign of mahatma is being in divine nature, not material control. This is effected by surrendering to Supreme Personality, Sri Krsna (as per Chapter Seven), freeing one from material nature's control. This is preliminary formula. Freed from material nature, living entity is put under spiritual nature's guidance (daivi prakrti). Promoted thus by surrender, one attains mahatma stage.

{"question": "What are the activities of a mahatma, and what is called full Krsna consciousness, according to the purport of Gita 9.14?", "answer": "The purport states mahatma symptoms: always engaged in chanting Krsna's glories. No other business. Not impersonalist; glorification means praising Lord's holy name, eternal form, transcendental qualities, uncommon pastimes. Mahatma is attached to Supreme Personality. Engaged in devotional service (hearing, chanting about Visnu - sravanam kirtanam visnoh, smaranam). Firm determination to achieve Lord's association in one of five rasas.

{"question": "Who are the three types of lower worshippers of Krsna mentioned in the purport of Gita 9.15, and which is most predominant?", "answer": "The purport explains some not exactly mahatmas worship Krsna differently. Besides distressed, destitute, inquisitive, knowledge cultivators, there are lower ones in three types: 1) Worshipper of self as one with Supreme Lord (monist mentality) - most predominant. They think they are Supreme. 2) Concocter of some form of Supreme Lord and worshipper of that (e.g., demigod worshippers considering any form as Supreme). 3) Accepter of universal form (visvarupa) and worshipper of that (considering universe as supreme organism).", "source_chapter": "9", "source_verse": "15"}

{"question": "What does it mean that Vedic sacrifices recommended in karma-kanda are also Krsna, according to the purport of Gita 9.16?", "answer": "The purport explains sacrifice jyotistoma is Krsna; He is maha-yajna. Pitrloka oblations, drug-like clarified butter, mantras chanted, milk products offered, fire (material element, Krsna's separated energy) – all are Krsna.

In material existence, we form relationships with living entities (Krsna's marginal energy). Under prakrti, some appear as father, mother, etc., but are parts of Krsna. 'Dhata' means creator. Not only father/mother but their creator, grandparents are also Krsna. Any living entity, part of Krsna, is Krsna. All Vedas aim only toward Krsna.

One not knowing Krsna is misled. Many aim for demigods, reaching planets like Candraloka, Suryaloka via rigid methods. These planets, Krsna's creations/energy manifestations, are Krsna and not Krsna, serving as steps to realize Krsna. Approaching Krsna's different energies is indirect approach.

He checks/gives rain. Energy sustaining life is Krsna; Krsna is also death. Analyzing these energies shows Krsna is both matter and spirit. In advanced Krsna consciousness, no such distinctions are made; one sees Krsna only in everything.

Pure devotee worshipping Supreme only achieves Vaikuntha/Krsnaloka. Unfortunately, many have no information of these sublime planets and fall down. Even impersonalists fall from brahmajyoti. Krsna consciousness movement distributes sublime information: simply by chanting Hare Krsna mantra, one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead.", "source_chapter": "9", "source_verse": "25"}

{"question": "What foods should not be offered to Krsna, and what are the proper foods prescribed by Him, according to the purport of Gita 9.26?", "answer": "The purport explains one wishing devotional service should find out what Lord desires. One loving Krsna gives what He wants, avoids undesirable/unasked. Meat, fish, eggs should not be offered. If He desired them, He'd have said so. He clearly requests leaf, fruit, flowers, water. So, He won't accept meat, fish, eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk, water are proper foods for humans, prescribed by Krsna. Other foods can't be offered; He won't accept.

But for devotees, He gives specific attention. This isn't discrimination; it's natural, like a charitable man's special interest in his own children. Devotees are always in Krsna consciousness, transcendentally in Krsna. 'Krsna consciousness' suggests those in it are living transcendentalists, situated in Him.
